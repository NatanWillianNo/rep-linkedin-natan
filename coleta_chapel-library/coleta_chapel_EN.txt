Título: All Comers to Christ Welcome
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Charles Spurgeon begins with the comforting words of Christ, “All that the Father giveth me shall come to me.”  No greater assurance is there than in knowing that the Savior will save all those who are His.  In this tract the author counsels the reader to come to Christ alone and follow Christ alone, for it is not our “fitness” that saves but Christ’s power alone.

Descrição: About 
All of Grace
: “The object of this book is the salvation of the reader. He who spoke and wrote it will be greatly disappointed if it does not lead many to the Lord Jesus. It is sent forth in childlike dependence upon the power of God the Holy Ghost, to use it in the conversion of millions, if so He pleases…Reader, do you mean business in reading these pages? If so, we are agreed at the outset; but nothing short of your finding Christ and heaven is the business aimed at here. Oh that we may seek this together! I do so by dedicating this little book with prayer. Will not you join me by looking up to God, and asking him to bless you while you read?”—
C.H. Spurgeon, from Chapter One.

Título: Am I Really a Christian?
Autor: Thomas Boston
Descrição: Though it would certainly be unkind to give false assurance of salvation to someone who has not been truly converted, it would be equally cruel to withhold comfort and assurance to a weak lamb who suffers with despair over his spiritual state. In his spiritual classic 
Human Nature in Its Fourfold State, 
Thomas Boston lists eight "cases" where a true Christian might have spiritual doubts about the authenticity of his faith. Such doubts, Boston notes, "may hinder some persons from the comfortable view of their happy state." Thus, he writes to encourage, comfort, and assure those saints who are burdened with such doubts.

Título: Andrew Dunn: An Irish Story
Autor: Thomas Kelly
Descrição: Redemption, forgiveness, and God’s amazing grace is the story of Andrew Dunn.  This small booklet traces the latter part of the life of Andrew Dunn, an “educated Roman Catholic” from Ireland in the mid-18
th
 century.  Although raised a Catholic, Andrew realized his ignorance of the gospel and sought help from his local priest.  Through dialogues with his priest, the reading of the Bible, and the work of the Holy Spirit, Andrew came to understand the truth of Romans 1:16:  “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ:  for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.”  This booklet is full of the transforming power of God’s gospel and will encourage your walk with Him.

Título: Anguish and Agonies of Spurgeon
Autor: Darrel W. Amundsen
Descrição: The sermons of Charles Spurgeon, the beloved preacher, exude great joy in the Lord, and sometimes humor, but he was also no stranger to depression, rejection by others, and physical suffering. His spiritual sufferings taught him to hate sin and cherish God’s holiness. The persecution of those who opposed his ministry was all but crushing, and his many physical ailments were great trials to him.  Through it all he was able to exemplify a confidence in God’s sovereignty and love. In his last sermon he stated that “the heaviest end of the cross lies ever on His shoulders.”  May Charles Spurgeon’s words of trust and reliance help all of God's children when they go through their dark valley.

Título: Anxiety
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this short and especially timely tract in view of today’s theatening environment, A. W. Pink urges us to understand that anxiety is a sin “as definitely as theft.” He goes on to point out that this needs to be carefully pondered “so that we don’t excuse it as an innocent infirmity.” He gives three suggestions for overcoming this sin.
 
Implore the Holy Spirit to grant us a deeper conviction of its enormity.
 
Make it a subject of earnest prayer that we may be delivered from this evil.
 
Watch for its beginning, and as soon as we detect an anxious, unbelieving thought, lift up our heart to God and ask for deliverance.
 
According to Pink, the best antidote for anxiety is frequent meditation on God’s goodness, power, and sufficiency, realizing from Psalm 23 that “The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.”

Descrição: “Just now we have to do with [those], who are not far from the kingdom, but have come right up to the wicket gate which stands at the head of the way of life. One would think that they would hasten to enter, for a free and open invitation is placed over the entrance, the porter waits to welcome them, and there is but this one way to eternal life. He that is most loaded seems the most likely to pass in and begin the heavenward journey; but what ails the other men? This is what I want to find out. Poor fellows! they have come a long way already to get where they are; and the King’s highway, which they seek, is right before them: why do they not take to the Pilgrim Road at once?…Only the Lord Himself can …lead them to take the great decisive step. Yet the Lord works by means; and I have prepared this little book in the earnest hope that He may work by it to the blessed end of leading seekers to an immediate, simple trust in the Lord Jesus.”          —

John Murray answers these questions in this carefully written booklet. He looks at the atonement as obedience, sacrifice, propitiation, reconciliation, and redemption.
 
"In a warm devotional manner and with a lucid style, Professor Murray brings to light the Biblical significance of the terms used to express the atonement.  He clearly reveals that the definitive terms of Scripture do not impugn the love of God but bring it out in bold relief."                       —

Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Just as Jesus allowed Lazarus to sicken and die to show His own glory by raising him from the dead, so our Lord often takes His own people through times of suffering to show them more of His own gracious care. This tract by Spurgeon assures the believer that though God's children are often afflicted, they are as surely beloved. Even death is merely God's calling his loved ones home to Himself. 
 
This message was preached before an audience of invalid ladies at Mentone, France, in 1880. It is taken from The Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit, Vol. 26, #1518.

Título: Benefits of Christ, The
Autor: Don Benedetto
Descrição: The Benefits of Christ 
was arguably the most popular book of the short lived Italian Reformation. It is estimated that 40,000 to 80,000 copies were printed between 1541-1548, of which very few remain today due to the fact that most were burned once the title was placed on the list of prohibited books during the Inquisition. The treatise was originally published anonymously under the title 
Trattato Ultilissimo Del Beneficio Di Geisu Christo Crocifisso
, and was for a few hundred years mistakenly attributed to Aonio Paleario (1503-1570), a martyr for the Reformation cause in Italy. But most scholars now agree, based on records from the Inquisition itself, that the “Trattato” was written by Don Benedetto, a student of the Spanish Reformer Juan de Valdes (1498?-1541) and friend of Peter Martyr Vermigli (1499- 1562). 
 
The subjects of this booklet include original sin, the purpose of the Law, our salvation depends upon Christ, the effects of living faith, clothed with Christ, and remedies against unbelief.

Descrição: "There was nothing great about Bethlehem.  It was 'little among the thousands of Judah' (Mic 5:2); perhaps but a shepherd-village or small market-town; yet there the great purpose of God became a 
fact
; 'The Word was made flesh.'"
 
Thus begins this tract by Horatius Bonar about the incarnation.  Here we see the glory of God becoming man and the love that God showed in sending His Son to live and die in humility.  At Bethlehem we can learn about the way to God, the vanity of the earth, a life of holiness, a heart of humility, and self denial.

Descrição: Christ's will as revealed in Scripture is the pattern for the church, and Nehemiah Coxe unfolds aspects of that pattern that relate to church leadership. "The edification and beauty of the Church is much concerned in her order, not such an order as superstition will dictate, or litigious nicety contend for, but such as sets her in a conformity with Christ's will; and particularly the filling up of the offices which He has appointed, with persons duly qualified for the administration of them, and the regular acting both of officers and members in their respective positions."

Título: Biblical Eldership
Autor: Alexander Strauch
Descrição: Misunderstanding abounds on the true role of a church elder!  Here we are shown the Biblical responsibilities and qualifications for this important office.  Strauch also details the apostolic pattern and directive for a church led by elders.
 
"...When properly implemented, biblical eldership allows the church to be what God designed it to be, fosters the spiritual development of the leading men within the church family, and honors the teaching of God's precious Word."

Título: Biblical Repentance: Need of the Hour
Autor: Lee Roy Shelton, Jr.
Descrição: "Why is 
Biblical repentance 
the need of this hour? Because we are living in a day when most religious leaders actually deny the 
need 
for repentance."  Thus Pastor Shelton opens this booklet on the nature and necessity of true repentance.  First, he presents the underlying problem of man's sin which calls for repentance.  Second, he defines and explains what repentance is and how it is connected with faith.  Third, he brings us to the means of repentance, which is the Word of God. Last, he shows us the fruits of genuine repentance in a hatred for sin and a desire for holiness.

Autor: William Reid
Descrição: The blood of Christ is here shown to be crucial to all the blessings of our salvation, including our forgiveness, peace, joy, holiness, and regeneration. Reid spends twelve chapters speaking of the glory of the atonement through Christ's blood and its effects in our lives.
 
"We believe that the refreshing truth, that 'the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin' (1Jo 1:7), is the great central sun that sheds a flood of light on the whole system of divine revelation. Atonement by the blood-shedding of Christ is the substratum of Christianity, for the sole ground of a sinner's peace with God is 'the blood of Jesus.'"            —
from Chapter 11.

He shows the necessity of teaching children their need of a Savior and the doctrine of the atonement.  This will also be very helpful for parents in teaching their children.

Título: Bondage of the Will, The
Autor: Martin Luther
Descrição: The Bondage of the Will
 is considered by many to be Luther’s most important book, and it stands today as one of the great classics in Christian history. He wrote in 1525 at the beginning of the Reformation in answer to a work by Erasmus, the classical scholar and humanist (1469-1536). Both Erasmus and Luther rejected many of the erroneous practices of the Roman Catholic church. But Luther went further to challenge the Roman teaching of salvation by works. Erasmus pleased the Pope by writing to uphold the Roman dogma of “free will,” that man could of himself decide to choose for his salvation. Luther saw correctly that the Biblical doctrines of the depravity of man and salvation by faith alone stand together. He declared Erasmus to be an enemy of the faith, and wrote 
The Bondage of the Will
 to establish this doctrine at the core of evangelicalism. The 
Modern English Series
 are modernized abridgments of great Christian classics, for a blessing to many worldwide.

describes God's concern for children in winsome terms easy for a child to understand. Drawing from the fact that in the restored Jerusalem "the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing" (Zec 8:5), Ryle assures little ones that God thinks about boys and girls and He allows them to play. Then he urges them in their playing to remember the eye and ear of God, keep their tempers, not neglect work because of play, and to remember that true happiness comes not from the innocent joys of play but from Christ alone.

Descrição: Thomas Brooks contrasts the true Christian with the deceitful hypocrite. As he considers the dark state of the hypocrite against the sincere light of the truth of God in the Christian, he reminds the reader: "The ends of a man’s actions are always a great discovery either of sincerity or hypocrisy." After exploring the sinfulness of hypocrisy and the blessedness of God-glorifying sincerity, Brooks gives remedies to the spirit of hypocrisy and principles to aid the soul which "sets the crown on  Christ’s head alone; he will set  God upon the throne, and make all  things else his servants, or his footstool. . . The daily language of sincere souls is this:  Not unto us, Lord,  not unto us,  Lord, but  to thy  name be all the glory."

Título: Candid Examination of the Scofield Bible, A
Autor: Albertus Pieters
Descrição: “The Scofield Bible may be called perhaps the most influential single work thrust into the religious life of America during the twentieth century. Those who use this work are, in other respects, among the best Christians in our churches. These good people do not lack faith and zeal, but they sadly lack knowledge; and the tragedy of the situation lies just here, that this is the very thing they think they have obtained from the Scofield Bible! In general Bible knowledge, Scofield makes many mistakes, and in his eschatology he goes far astray from anything the Church has ever believed.”
 
This booklet holds four erroneous doctrinal areas of the Scofield Bible up to biblical light to reveal its errors and set the reader on the right path of orthodox Christianity: 1) artificial typology, 2) doctrine of dispensations and covenants, 3) eschatology, and 4) doctrine of the church.

Título: Canons of Dort, The
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: The Canons of Dort
 
is the explanation of the judicial decision regarding objections to the faith of the Reformation, from the official church council held in The Netherlands in 1618-1619. Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609) was a Dutch theologian and prominent pastor in Amsterdam. He was eloquent and well educated, his sermons attracting large audiences not only for their content but for their controversy. According to Arminius, the orthodox faith of the Reformation was wrong. He taught that God chooses for salvation only those whom He has foreseen will believe. By 1592 Arminius had been formally accused of heresy. In 1610, his zealous followers presented five objections to the standard confessions of faith from the Reformation; the theology behind these objections came to be called 
Arminianism. 
 
The whole church was caught up with theological debate, and a council was called to resolve the controversy. The Synod of Dort concluded with a rejection of Arminianism, and in 
The Canons of Dort 
set forth the orthodox Reformed doctrine on each point; today these are sometimes referred to as 
the doctrines of grace
. As termed in the original preface, it is a “judgment, in which both the true view agreeing with God’s Word concerning the aforesaid five points of doctrine is explained, and the false view disagreeing with God’s Word is rejected.”

Título: Catechism for Boys and Girls, A
Autor: Erroll Hulse
Descrição: This simple catechism is very helpful for teaching young children to understand and remember the basic truths of the Christian faith.
The  Westminster Assembly produced not only its well-known Confession of Faith, but also the Longer Catechism (for pastors’ use in teaching their congregations) and Shorter Catechism (for parents’ use in teaching their children). Soon thereafter, Benjamin Keach (1640-1704) tailored the Westminster Shorter Catechism to the London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 (which is based on the Westminster except in its chapters on church government, the covenants, and baptism). Later, Charles Spurgeon (1834-1892) updated Keach’s catechism for his own congregation. 
 
More recently, Erroll Hulse knew that a more simplified Baptist catechism was needed so that parents could train their young children at home. The 134 short questions and answers encompass all the key doctrines of the faith, including sections on God-Man-Sin, Salvation, The Ten Commandments, Prayer, The Word, The Church and Ordinances, and Last Things.

"Come with me to the foot of the mountain of presumption. See there the maimed and writhing forms of many who once soared with Icarian wings in the airy regions of self-confidence; yet there they lie with their bones broken, and their peace destroyed. There lies one who had immortal life within him; see how full of pain he appears, and he looks a mass of helpless matter. He is alive, it is true, but just alive."

Have you bowed at His feet in repentance and faith? Has he come into your heart and subdued you by conquest?"

As the Old Testament High Priest bore the iniquities of Israel's offerings, Christ our High Priest has made the Christian acceptable to God and abundantly pardons all insufficiencies in the Christian's spiritual duties and offerings. In Christ, "Is  not  this,  then,  truly  blessed?  To  have  such  complete  provision  made  for  our  pardon  and  acceptance,  as  well as  for  the  acceptance  of  our  holy  things!  To  have  such  an  High  Priest  over  the  house  of  God—that  house  into which  we,  in  believing,  entered,  and  from  which  we  shall  go  out  no  more!  We  are  'complete  in  Him.'  In ourselves  most  incomplete,  in  our  duties  most  incomplete,  in  our  worship  most  incomplete,  but  yet  in  Him COMPLETE!"

Marshall proclaims the truth that Christ "loved us in our most loathsome sinful pollution, so as to die for us, and much more will He love us in it, so as to receive us when we come to Him for the purchased salvation." To those who have already received Christ and been received by Him, he gives a call to holiness by continual faith in the grace and Spirit of Christ, not trusting in their own works, but walking by faith in Him.

Título: Christian and the World, The
Autor: I. C. Herendeen
Descrição: The world is one of the Christian’s three great enemies, along with the flesh and the devil. According to I. C. Herendeen, the world represents the kingdom of Satan, populated by the unregenerate part of humanity. It is fallen human nature in rebellion against God and acting under the influence of the devil. While we are in the world, we must not be of the world—always aware of God’s command, “Be not conformed to this world” (Rom. 12:2). Not only that, but we should consider ourselves travelers in a foreign land, for this world was never meant to be our home. On the other hand, Herendeen cautions us not to stand aloof from all relationships with unconverted people; our Lord certainly did not. In the end he challenges us, “Persevere in your separation from the world…you will never regret having lived too holy and too separated a life.”

Autor: John Bunyan
Descrição: According to the Bible what are good works? How should they function in a Christian’s life? In this booklet, John Bunyan addresses these and related issues in detail. Citing Titus 3:7-8, he summarizes its message: “they which have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works.” Bunyan goes on to point out several aspects of good works that all believers should know and apply. First, recognize that good works flow from faith and not the other way around. Second, be careful to insure that the works one does are actually good—here Bunyan describes the duties of Christians in the family and other relationships. Third, do not be satisfied with simply a commendable beginning, but continue faithfully in a life of good works. Lastly, Bunyan urges Christians to understand and believe in the doctrine of justification by grace—as a powerful motivation for doing good works.

Título: Christian Fools
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: No one wants to be thought a fool. However, taking Luke 24:25 as his text, A. W. Pink illustrates why those Christians who are “lopsided in their theology” may be considered foolish. They are lopsided in that they believe some scriptures, but not all scriptures because they are “unable to harmonize the two different parts of God’s truth.” Indeed, tying themselves down to a theological system, they “place a higher value on 
consistency
 than they do fidelity.” He expands on this under four headings: using reason rather than faith, holding to a theology that is narrower than scripture, viewing the various parts of God’s word in a disproportionate way, and “proving” truth by creed and logic. In summary, Pink gives a timely admonishment to all believers, counseling them to insure that they fit their theology to Scripture rather than Scripture to their theology.

How does indwelling sin fit into the picture where God assures us that we have the victory in Christ Jesus? The believer in Jesus Christ still has a sinful flesh that struggles against the Holy Spirit and his renewed nature. This struggle will continue all his days, but by God's grace he can experience victory by a living relationship with Jesus Christ!

Título: Christian Modesty
Autor: Jeff Pollard
Descrição: God’s Word has much to say about the way we dress, especially in worship. 
Christian Modesty and the Public Undressing of America
 examines relevant portions of Scripture and investigates a little fashion history in order to present a Biblical doctrine of modesty. This is an important discussion for both men and women. While this controversial subject often falls into the realm of subjective experience and speculation, the author begins with a study of Holy Scripture. An examination of fashion authorities and historians of modern culture also reveals that the fashion industry, which believes that sexual attraction equals beauty, has been hard at work convincing society to undress in public. Because of its unbiblical worldview, the fashion industry persistently justifies the exposure and the sensualizing of the human body, a trend that many undiscerning Christians have unfortunately adopted. 
Christian Modesty
 is an urgent call to the churches of Jesus Christ to study this matter carefully and to practice a modesty that brings glory to our Holy Redeemer and gives a powerful testimony of purity within our decadent society.

Título: Christian Survey of the Old Testament
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: A Christian Survey of the Old Testament
 explores how the Old Covenant prepares for the New Covenant in Christ in dramatic and mysterious ways. We see God’s character displayed in the beginnings of the world and of man. But sin appears, and its terrible consequences bring the just judgments of God. God then shows His love and mercy in setting apart one family to become His very own people. God redeems them from slavery, gives them His Law, and declares to them His holiness—and they willingly enter into a national covenant with Him. By God’s grace, they become a great nation reflecting the Kingdom of God: His people, in His place, under His rule. By His prescribed sacrifices, sinners can live with the holy God in their midst. Yet from this blessed place, the united kingdom divides, and Israel and then Judah fall prey to pride, idolatry, formalism, and spiritual adultery. God sends His prophets to their kings, repeatedly calling the nation to repentance and faith. But the people will not hear, and God dramatically uses new empires to judge His very own. Even then, however, there is hope in God’s gracious promises: a Redeemer will come to deliver once and for all His people from their sins.
 
“The knowledge of God…appears throughout as an internal expansion, an organic unfolding from within…The gospel of Paradise is such a germ in which the gospel of Paul is potentially present: and the gospel of Abraham, of Moses, of David, of Isaiah and Jeremiah, are all expansions of this original message of salvation, each pointing forward to the next stage of growth and bringing the gospel idea one step nearer to its full realization.”—

Autor: Albert N. Martin
Descrição: The wedding services conducted in our churches either validate and hold forth in clarity the truth of the gospel, or they erode and compromise the truth of the Word of God, in doctrinal content or in practical application. Many current trends in the wedding practices among evangelical Christians are not contributing to the vital function of the church as “the pillar and ground of the truth” (1Ti 3:15). Nothing but thorough biblical reformation will once again cause the truth of the gospel to shine with penetrating brilliance before the eyes of men. 
The Christian Wedding in a Changing World 
helps churches, families, and engaged couples to pursue plans for a wedding ceremony that will indeed illustrate and validate the truth of God, bring a maximum measure of glory to God, and elicit unmingled joy among the gathered people of God!

Título: Christian's Warfare, The
Autor: Robert Murray McCheyne
Descrição: In this tract, Robert Murray McCheyne gives a vivid description of the warfare that plagues all true believers. He first explains why there is no such warfare for an unbeliever. In short, the unbeliever hates the law of God and will not obey it, happily pandering to his sinful flesh. But when he comes to Christ, this is all changed. He can now truly say that he loves God’s law, which has been written on his heart. He soon discovers, however, that this sets off continuing conflict against indwelling sin. In the midst of these battles, the believer feels wretched about his sin, seeks the Lord for deliverance, and gives thanks for each victory. The fight against the flesh never ceases in this life, but according to McCheyne, there is a sure promise that in the end sin shall be rooted out altogether.

is the motivation; the church’s

is the necessity when restoration fails. With thorough exegesis and scholarly authority, Owen exhorts the church in Biblical understanding and practice of Matthew 18:15-20.

Título: Church Discipline
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: Why are American churches so weak, powerless, worldly, and increasingly irrelevant in our culture? D. M. Lloyd-Jones gives us at least one reason by asking, "When did you last hear any reference from a Christian pulpit to the subject of discipline? How often have you heard sermons or addresses on the subject? The word has almost gone right out of existence and what it stands for and represents has fallen into disuse."
 
In light of this, this Free Grace Broadcaster takes up Church Discipline. R. Albert Mohler, Jr., introduces this crucial subject by explaining the historical and cultural reasons that church discipline has vanished from American churches. Hezekiah Harvey then biblically defines church discipline. James Bannerman reveals from Scripture that discipline did not originate with human tradition: it was a positive institution by Jesus Christ the Head of the Church. John Gill then instructs us in the biblical ways that a church admits people to or excludes them from its membership. In a second article, Mohler demonstrates that Christ-instituted discipline preserves the visible purity of those who profess the name of the risen Christ. Daniel Wray explains the necessity of discipline, followed by a third article from Mohler that describes the three vital areas that require discipline. What are the modes of church discipline? What is Christ's church authorized to do in this matter? Daniel Wray answers these questions for us. Excommunication is a difficult subject, and Jonathan Edwards details the nature of this severe discipline. No one can practice this in church life without encountering objections. Wray gives answers to a few of the more common ones. Finally, Charles Spurgeon exhorts us personally and as congregations of Christ Jesus to keep the Lord's chruch pure.

Título: Come To Me!
Autor: Tom Wells
Descrição: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”
—Matthew 11:28-30
 
These are, perhaps, the best known and most frequently heard words which Jesus ever spoke. They are read at church services, funerals, and many other occasions. They are often called “the comfortable words.” But what do they mean? What does it mean to “come” to Jesus? Who is He, and why should we “come” to Him? In this attractive presentation of the Christian faith, Tom Wells answers these questions. In an engaging style he explains who Jesus Christ is and what it means to “come” to Him. He writes honestly about the barriers which stand in the way of faith, and about the cost involved in being a disciple. But he also shows clearly that there is nothing more important we can ever do than “come” to Christ.

Título: Come Unto Me All Ye That Labour
Autor: Thomas Boston
Descrição: Come Unto Me, All Ye That Labor is an exposition of Matthew 11:28. Thomas Boston shows the nature of the burden of sin which weighs upon the guilty conscience as it's lusts drives those under its dominion, which "lie  on  them  as  a  burden  on  the  weary  beast,  which  weary  them indeed." He then emphasizes the free grace of Christ in His invitation to weary sinners. Who is Christ inviting? What does it mean to come to Christ? What kind of rest is Christ promising to them? Boston shows sinners they are welcome to come to Christ. “However full Christ’s house be, there is always room for more. He wearies not of welcoming sinners; the more that come the better...Come,  says  he,  with  all  your  misery,  debts,  beggary,  and  wants,  I  have shoulders  to  bear  them  all;  I  will  take  on  the  burden,  ye  shall  get  rest.”

Título: Comfort for Christians
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: "God has a 'people,' the objects of His special favor: a company whom He has taken into such intimate relationship unto Himself that He calls them 'My people.' Often they are disconsolate: because of their natural corruptions, the temptations of Satan, the cruel treatment of the world, the low state of Christ’s cause upon earth. The 'God of all comfort' (2Co 1:3) is very tender of them, and it is His revealed will that His servants should bind up the broken-hearted and pour the balm of Gilead into their wounds. What cause have we to exclaim: 'Who is a God like unto thee' (Mic 7:18), Who has provided for the comfort of those who were rebels against His government and transgressors of His Law.
 
"The contents of this little volume have appeared from time to time in our monthly magazine during the last thirty years. They were, previously, sermons which we preached long ago in the USA and Australia. Here and there is an expression (especially where prophecy is touched upon) that we would not use today; but since the Lord was pleased to bless them in their original form to not a few of His distressed people, we have not revised them. May it please Him to speak peace by them to afflicted souls today, and the glory shall be His alone."

Autor: Jerome Zanchius
Descrição: Jerome Zanchius sums up the theme of this short work by highlighting the sovereignty of God as a comfort to believers in the midst of their suffering. Referring to Romans 8:28-29, he explains that without a strong sense of the personal predestination revealed in verse 29, we lack “the most powerful inducement to patience, resignation, and dependence on God, under every spiritual and temporal affliction.” Zanchius goes on to offer a long list of sweet considerations for the distressed believer and ends with encouraging words—when the suffering Christian takes into account his election and that the sufferings of this present life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed to the saints, what adversity can possibly befall him which these blessings will not infinitely overbalance?

Descrição: In this short tract, Thomas Wilcox expounds on Christ’s message in Matthew 11:28. Focusing on the first three words, “Come unto me,” he highlights three points:
 
First.
 “Christ has drunk up all the Father’s wrath at one draught; and nothing but salvation is left for you.” 
 
Second.
 In coming to Christ, “You must leave behind your own righteousness, and bring nothing but your sin.”
 
Third.
 If you say you cannot believe or repent, “Go to Christ with all your impenitence and unbelief to get faith and repentance from Him.”
 
According to Wilcox, “Christ will be a pure Redeemer and Mediator, and you must be an undone sinner, or Christ and you will never agree.”

"But did I hear you whisper that this was not a convenient time? Then what must I say to you? When will that convenient time come? Shall it come when you are in hell? Will that time be convenient? Shall it come when you are on your dying bed, and the death throttle is in your throat—shall it come then? Or when the burning sweat is scalding your brow...No, sir, this morning is the convenient time."

Descrição: “For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living” (Job 30:23). Choosing this as his text, Charles Spurgeon wades fearlessly into a discussion of the one subject that many—even Christians—would rather not think about. But think about it we must. Spurgeon puts it this way, “You have something yet to learn if you are a Christian and yet are not prepared to die.” He invites all believers to “look this home-going in the face” until they see no gloom and dread, but a very heaven of hope and glory. He ends with beautiful and poetic words of encouragement to those who are destined for the glory land. “If you have chosen Christ, mercy, and eternal life…begin to enjoy them now. Rehearse the music of the skies. Taste the delights of fellowship with God even here.”

Título: Confidence in God in Times of Danger
Autor: Alexander Carson
Descrição: Confidence in God in Times of Danger
 is a passionate explanation of God’s workings in the Book of Esther. The author moves from Biblical insight to practical application in the lives of God’s people today. When the times are turbulent and filled with all manner of possible dangers, the great God of the Bible is in control and can be trusted completely.
 
“We learn that the most casual events which take place in the affairs of the world are connected with God’s plans respecting His people; and that the most trifling things are appointed and directed by Him to effect His purposes. It decides a question that philosophy has conversed for ages, and will never fathom; recording a number of events, the result of man’s free will, yet evidently appointed of God and directed by His providence. From this book the believer may learn to place unbounded confidence in the care of his God in the utmost danger; and to look to the Lord of omnipotence for deliverance when there is no apparent means of escape.”

The Consistent Christian 
is without doubt the richest book we have ever read on practical Christian living. In order to gain the most spiritual profit from the book, it must be carefully perused. It is much like the book of Proverbs, where each line must be contemplated. Secker abounds in the use of comparisons and contrasts, often using several analogies in the same sentence. Similar to the Old Testament authors, at times Secker ‘purposely exaggerates’ the wording to make his point. This handbook for Christian living will be a treasure to all serious Christians.”

Título: Contemplation of God, The
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this tract, A. W. Pink looks at three aspects of God’s being—His incomprehensibility, all-sufficiency, and absolute sovereignty. While incomprehensible in His totality, God has not left us completely in the dark, but revealed certain truths about Himself in His Word. According to Pink, studying these truths should teach us humility, caution, and reverence. Pink goes on to explain that God is all-sufficient in Himself and to Himself. He can receive nothing from another nor be limited by the power of another. Finally, as the Supreme Sovereign of the universe, God exercises His sovereignty according to His own imperial and righteous pleasure. He has mercy on whom He will, and whom He will He hardens. Pink leaves us with this sobering comment: “To the Christian, He is a tender Father; to the rebellious sinner He will yet be a consuming fire.”

Título: Conversion of Zaccheus
Autor: George Whitefield
Descrição: In this booklet, Great Awakening evangelist George Whitefield uses the conversion of Zaccheus to illustrate that salvation is a free gift of God. He shows, in the first place, that there is nothing in Zaccheus that makes him fit for salvation. On the contrary, as a publican, he was “in all probability a notorious sinner.” Whitefield further points out that Jesus calls him by name. Zaccheus had come to see Jesus out of curiosity, but according to His sovereign, electing grace, Jesus, who had known this man from eternity, now effectually calls him in time. Concluding his sermon, Whitefield implores his listeners, “Make haste, O ye publicans and sinners, and give the dear Lord Jesus your hearts, your whole hearts.” He ends with a plaintive prayer, “O that you may know the things that belong to your everlasting peace, before they are eternally hid from your eyes.”

In the spirit of the Bereans, the author deals with the whole of Scripture to support and defend his premise. In many quarters, these principles have been overrun in our day by Dispensationalism, and its outworkings in Antinomianism and Arminianism.

Since man was not present ineternity or at the beginning, scientifically he can only postulate (to assume or assert something as a basisof argument), hypothesize, and theorize about origins and then test by observation and analysis ofpresent data. This must be done with presuppositions about and extrapolation into the past based on orderived from that data. In the final analysis both scientific models, creation or evolution, lead to a matterof faith. Scientifically, the model that is most likely correct is the one which the data best fits. Therefore,let’s take a simplistic look at these two models in the light of some of the data..."

It is the place of propitiation, reconciliation, love, and acceptance. In the cross Christ accomplished great things for us, bringing us life, making peace, and removing the wall of partition. The whole revelation of God points to the cross, as this is where God meets with man. Our response to the cross will lead to life for those who believe and death for those who reject it.

Título: Cross-Bearing
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this tract, A. W. Pink examines Matthew 16:24 which consists of three elements—denying one’s self, taking up one’s cross, and following Christ. Pink indicates that denying one’s self isn’t limited to simply giving up things we like, but means “being done with self” completely. He likens this to Romans 12:1, “Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.” Taking up one’s cross is essentially embracing an instrument of death. According to Pink, the cross stands for several hallmarks of Christ’s life—the world’s hatred, voluntary surrender to the will of God, and sacrificial suffering and death. His conclusion is this: legally, the cross of Christ stands alone as it put away the guilt of our sins, but as deliverance from the power of sin in our lives, the cross is to be shared by all believers.

Título: Cure for Despondency
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: Based on David’s words in Psalm 42:5, A. W. Pink instructs his readers in how to respond when downcast and dejected in heart. The short answer is to do what David did as he preached to himself, “Hope thou in God.” Hope in His mercy; hope in His love; hope in His power—because “Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all” (Psalm 34:19).

Autor: Horatius Bonar
Descrição: In this booklet, Horatius Bonar begins by giving a vivid description of the spiritual malady in his day. “It is to be feared that much of what is called religion with us is a mere outward name—a shadow, a spectre, with nothing of solidity or life. The faith of those who thus receive it stands in the wisdom of men, and not in the power of God. It speaks no more of Jesus only, and His all-sufficiency. It attracts many to Him now, who are not drawn of the Father.” Referring to Mark 9:29, Bonar then lays out the divine cure, “My brethren, the remedy is at hand: prayer and fasting. Here is the appointed cure—the cure which God has put in your hands, and of whose efficacy He has assured you.” The malady and the cure are certainly no different in our day.

Autor: Legh Richmond
Descrição: The Dairyman’s Daughter 
is the true account of the life of Elizabeth Wallbridge, a young woman who lived on The Isle of Wight, just off the southern English coast near the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth. She died there at an early age in 1801. Her name, her surroundings, her conversion and death were related with such power that literally millions of copies were sold prior to 1853 to satisfy the demand, and numbers of men, women, and children were brought to the Lord by this humble means.
 
This small booklet was translated into many languages during the 19
th
 century. It seems to have been signally honored by the Holy Spirit as an instrument to communicate God’s truth with humility and love.

Título: Danger of Delaying Repentance
Autor: Thomas Boston
Descrição: Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep. So shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an armed man. Proverbs 6:10-11. 
Thomas Boston begins by explaining his application of the text as follows, “The point I intend to speak to from these words is: the delaying and putting off of repentance is a soul-ruining course among gospel-hearers.” As he expounds on this, Boston shows why gospel-hearers delay repentance and why such a delay is so extremely dangerous. He points out that most have not decided they will 
never
 repent, but just not right now, and then offers nine reasons why this might be the case. He winds up by showing how perilous and terrifying are the potential consequences of delaying repentance, declaring that a moment’s delay risks eternal, irreparable loss—because any moment could be one’s last.

Descrição: In this gospel message on sin, death, and salvation from Romans 6:23, Spurgeon helps us to see the wages the sinner has earned and then brings us to the gift of God which is eternal life. "...Death is a 
wage
, but life is a 
gift
. Sin brings its natural consequences with it; but eternal life is not the purchase of human merit, but the free gift of the love of God. The abounding goodness of the Most High alone grants life to those who are dead by sin...
When a man is lost, he has earned it; when a man is saved, it is given him

Título: Decisional Regeneration
Autor: James Adams
Descrição: Decisional Regeneration
 has permeated much of the Christian Church in a deceptive way. Like Baptismal Regeneration, it sees the new birth as the result of a mechanical process that man performs, ignoring the sovereign work of God in giving men new hearts. The practice of Decisional Regeneration in the Church must be exposed—in order to save men from the damning delusion that because they have "decided" or "signed a card," they are going to heaven and are no longer under the wrath of God. The purpose of this booklet is not to question the sincerity of some Christians or to malign them, but to unite Christians in biblical truth. The gospel alone is the power of God unto salvation and the true basis of Christian unity.

Título: Decrees of God
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: A. W. Pink begins this tract by defining God’s decrees, declaring that they consist of “His purpose or determination with respect to future things.” Indeed, they “relate to all future things without exception: whatever is done in time was foreordained before time began.” Pink goes on to give four major properties of God’s decrees. First, they are eternal. That is, they were not done in time, but in eternity. Second, the decrees of God are wise. This wisdom is “shown in the selection of the best possible ends and of the fittest means of accomplishing them.” Third, they are free. His determinations were influenced by no external cause. And fourth, they are absolute and unconditional. Their execution is not dependent on any condition which may or may not be performed. Pink concludes with encouraging words—“how thankful we should be that everything is determined by infinite wisdom and goodness.”

Título: Defense of Calvinism, A
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Many Christians of various theological persuasions know and love Charles Spurgeon. But how many know that he was a committed Calvinist? If there was ever any doubt, Spurgeon’s words early in this booklet make it clear, “It is a nickname to call it Calvinism; Calvinism is the gospel, and nothing else.” Relating his personal conversion experience he writes, “Then in a moment, I saw that God was at the bottom of it all, and that He was the author of my faith.” Spurgeon goes on to consider  and defend various aspects of Calvinism under a number of headings, several of which delve into Calvinism’s well-known five points. Finally, he speaks of those Christians who “cannot see these truths” with true Christian charity, “They have received Christ as their Saviour, and are as dear to the heart of the God of grace as the soundest Calvinist.”

Descrição: This book is made up from a series of messages preached on the eternal sonship of Christ, His Deity, and His place in the Holy Trinity as God the Son. Jehovah God of the Old Testament is Jehovah Jesus, the Christ of God, of the New Testament. God in eternity planned and purposed that all things should head up in Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ of God. Oh, what glory is due our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom God the Father from eternity has made Lord over all! To deny the Deity of Christ is to deny the only Way of salvation. We are to embrace Him in all His offices as prophet, priest, and king and look to the salvation that the Divine Son has accomplished.

Directions for Profitable Hearing and Reading
 Puritan pastor and author Richard Baxter exhorts readers to take seriously the disciplines of hearing the Word preached, reading the Scriptures, and reading Christian books. It seems that some view hearing a sermon as a passive exercise and therefore miss out on the profit they could gain from it. Baxter highlights the importance of this means of grace and how our approach should reflect a keen appreciation of it. He urges us to come prayerfully, heartily, attentively, and with purpose. He then stirs the reader to a right approach to reading the Scriptures, the attitude with which to approach them, and thoughts on methods of study. He closes with an exhortation on reading Christian books: why to read, what not to read, and what to read.

Millons have already perished...There is the second death, the death beyond which there is no life for the impenitent...But still it remains true that God has no pleasure in man's death. He did not kindle hell in order to gratify His revenge. He does not cast sinners headlong into its endless flames in order to get vent to His blind fury...He will finally condemn the unbelieving, but not because He delights to do so, but because He is the righteous Lord that loveth righteousness."

Título: Divine Healing
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this booklet, A. W. Pink stakes out a Scriptural position that avoids two extremes regarding divine healing. These extremes include on the one hand, false teaching about divine healing—for example, the belief that healing is in the atonement—and on the other hand, the erroneous view that God 
never
 heals today. He elaborates on divine healing by first considering unscriptural teaching on the subject and then turning to what he calls “the positive side” of this issue. Under the latter, Pink looks at the general subject of human health and the duties and privileges of Christians in illness. Finally, he considers the implications of three well-known passages of Scripture—2 Chronicles 7:14, Matthew 9:29, and James 5:14-16.

Título: Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility
Autor: James Innell Packer
Descrição: Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility
 is a thoughtful examination of these two important doctrines of the Christian faith as they relate to God’s grace in salvation. There is abroad today a widespread suspicion that a robust faith in the absolute sovereignty of God is bound to undermine any adequate sense of human responsibility. The Bible presents both of these as true: 1) God’s sovereignty in electing some people to be saved, and 2) all peoples’ responsibility to call upon the Lord to be saved. Many err when they try to reconcile these two truths. They either affirm sovereignty and avoid calling men to turn to God; or they focus on encouraging men to “invite Christ into their hearts” and teach that God does not rule sovereignly over all of life. In this booklet, both truths are upheld as vital. One must not be neglected in order to be comfortable with the other. The author shows us how both truths coexist in the infinitely wise economy of God.
 
J. I. Packer

Knowing God 
and many other books, including 
Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God, 
from which this booklet was abstracted. He is professor of historical and systematic theology at Regent College in Vancouver, Canada.

Descrição: In this tract about salvation, Pastor Pollard takes as his text John 17:3. 
And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
 He points out that simply knowing 
about
 Christ will not change the sinner’s condition of spiritual death. To have eternal life, he must know Christ by intimate personal experience. Pollard goes on to explain the gospel in terms of Christ’s three offices. Jesus came as Prophet so that man might know God’s will. He came as Priest to offer Himself a sacrifice for the sins of His people. And He came as the sovereign King who grants His people faith and repentance leading to salvation. Conclusion: 
He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
 (1 John 5: 12).

Título: Do You Think You Are Converted?
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: In this booklet, J. C. Ryle explores the scriptural basis of conversion. In his clear and winsome style, Ryle first explains that conversion—in his words—is a scriptural thing, a real thing, a necessary thing, a possible thing, a happy thing, and a thing that may be seen. After expounding on these, he urges the reader to “Find out if you are converted” and “If you are not converted, never rest till you are.” Finally, Ryle has the following advice for those who believe they are converted: make your calling and conversion sure, remember that a converted man is still a sinner needing Christ every day, labor to grow in grace as long as you live, and lastly, share your faith. As Ryle puts it: “Never, never if you are a converted man, never be content to go to heaven alone!”

Título: Doctrine and Devotion
Autor: Ernest C. Reisinger
Descrição: Doctrine and Devotion 
must never be separated. Doctrine is to Christian experience what bones are to the body. Just as a body without bones would be utterly useless, so is Christian experience without doctrinal roots. It is like cut flowers stuck in the ground---they may look pleasant for a while, but ultimately they will whither and die. The other side of this truth is equally valid and instructive, that is, bones without flesh are but a dead skeleton!

Título: Doctrine of Assurance, The
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: According to A. W. Pink, a review of church history shows that there have been a number of errors regarding the doctrine of assurance, each of which calls for a different approach in preaching and teaching. These errors include the belief that no assurance of salvation is possible, or that assurance is too easily assumed because of casual “decisions for Christ,” or too difficult to believe in the face of indwelling sin. Pink goes on to offer a thorough Scriptural exposition of the doctrine under four headings: the nature of assurance, its basis, its attainment, and its hindrance, maintenance, and fruit. He concludes by offering several dialogues—with characters like Carnal Confidence and Humble Heart—which are designed to further explain and amplify his main points.

Descrição: The Doctrine of Human Depravity 
“is likely to meet with a decidedly mixed reception. Some of our readers will probably be very disappointed when they see the title, deeming the subject quite unattractive…Medicine is proverbially unpleasant, but there are times when all of us find it necessary and beneficial…Surely that which most glorifies God is to declare

His counsel, to insist on that which puts man in his proper place before Him, and to emphasize those portions and aspects of the truth which our generation is most in need of. As we shall endeavour to show, our theme is one of immense doctrinal importance and of great practical value, since it is a subject which occupies so prominent a place in God’s Word. It is our deep conviction that the vital question most requiring to be raised today is this: Is man a totally and thoroughly depraved creature by nature?...According as is our answer to 
that
 question, so will be our views on many others…Any attempt to modify or abate, repudiate or tone down the teaching of Scripture thereon is fatal.”—
A.W. Pink, from the Introduction

Título: Doctrine of Justification, The
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: A. W. Pink presents a succinct—yet thorough—explanation of the Biblical doctrine of justification. He reveals his motivation for writing up front, declaring that there was a time when justification was one of the best known doctrines of the Christian faith, but among many in his time there was almost total ignorance of this truth. He opens up the doctrine under nine headings: justification’s meaning, its problem, its basis, its nature, its source, its objects, its instrument, its evidence, and its results. In conclusion, Pink points out that while the Christian’s justification is complete the moment he truly believes in Christ, the following distinctions can be noted: justification was decreed from all eternity, was effective when Christ rose from the dead, is actuated when the Christian believes, felt when the Spirit bestows assurance, manifested on the path of obedience, and pronounced by God publicly at the Day of Judgment.

Título: Doctrine of Justification: Opened & Applied
Autor: Walter Marshall
Descrição: In a day when the righteousness of God is often ignored and the gospel often compromised, this booklet by Walter Marshall should be heeded as it delineates the nature of our justification before God. Considering justification in light of the totality of Scripture, Marshall tells his readers of the source and practical implications of this justification, noting both the saving and sanctifying effects of this powerful righteousness found in Christ. By this theological foundation, the sum of the gospel itself may be understood. "God, in setting forth Christ to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, aimed to declare His righteousness now under the gospel, for the remission of sins that are past as well as present."

Título: Doctrine of Repentance, The
Autor: Thomas Watson
Descrição: The Doctrine of Repentance
 is, by the witness of many, the finest exposition found in print of this vital Biblical doctrine. In his explanatory style filled with vivid illustrations, Watson presents the reader with the Biblical call for repentance. In concise chapters, he reveals counterfeit repentance as mere worldly sorrow over suffering the consequences of sin. He then describes the nature of true repentance, its necessity, motives, and effects. He closes with strong exhortations to repent from every sin, how to remove impediments, and the means for true repentance. It is truly a Christian classic—as useful in our day as it was over 300 years ago.

Descrição: God speaks to us by His Spirit, in the Scriptures. The Doctrine of Revelation explores that reality, how God communicates, and what that means for us. From the author’s Introduction: “Our principal object will be to set forth some of the numerous indications that the Bible is something far superior to any human production, but before doing that we must seek to establish the existence of its divine Author. The later chapters will be designed chiefly for preachers or older students of the Word, presenting as they will some of the rules which require to be heeded if the Scriptures are to be properly interpreted; and though their scope will go beyond the general title of ‘divine revelation,’ yet they will complement and complete the earlier ones.”

Título: Does God Love Everyone?
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: While God is love, Scripture does not allow us to view God's love as unreservedly applied to every individual person. God's saving love is fixed on His people and will be fulfilled in their eternal salvation.  While God extends His gracious offers of mercy to the unbelieving, their sin is repulsive to His holiness and in His justice He must punish the sin in the sinner.

Autor: Richard Adams
Descrição: In this booklet, Adams tackles an eminently practical subject: Scriptural guidelines concerning family duties. He sums up in the first page, “God’s pleasure and children’s encouragement should move Christian children to obedience and parents to moderate control in all things.” He then directs his attention to the children, elaborating on their primary duty of honoring and obeying their parents in four ways: compliance with their commands, reverence in speech and behavior, heartfelt gratitude, and submission to discipline. Turning to the parents, Adams admonishes them to “Rule over your children in such a way that they love and honor you for it.” Finally, after describing their many practical duties, he urges parents to be faithful in two foundational ways—praying always for their children and setting a good example in the way they live.

Título: Duties of Husbands and Wives
Autor: Richard Steele
Descrição: Puritan pastor Richard Steele introduces his subject with these words, “Marriage is the foundation of all society, and so this topic is very important.” Pointing out that marital duties are easier to learn than to put in practice, he expands on the overarching Biblical mandate that every husband’s duty is to love his wife and every wife’s duty is to respect her husband. Steele’s wisdom and insight throughout make this publication read like a miniature book of proverbs on marriage. A few examples:
 
 
Speak often of spiritual things. Be fellow-pilgrims to the Celestial City.
 
The purest love is expressed by earnest prayer, and prayer will preserve love. Seek times for prayer together.
 
Wink at lesser faults, and be careful in confronting greater ones.
 
Wives are like crystal glasses, easily broken if not tenderly handled.
 
Abigail behaved prudently with a very bad husband, and was raised to honor.
 
The upright husband and wife will strive each to do their own duty, and will be most severe against their own failures.
 
Humility keeps the husband from becoming a tyrant, and the wife in ready subjection to her husband.
 
Keep the golden rule in your marriage.

 invites sinners to come to the Lord Jesus Christ. From Isaiah1:18 the author declares God’s glorious invitation to every kind of sinner, even the very worst—those who are burdened by their sin as well as “religious” sinners.  What is the invitation? It is a call to come to terms with the free pardon purchased for sinners with Christ’s blood. This invitation comes from the sovereign King Himself. He calls sinners to submit to His gracious rule, come into His holy presence, and accept His cleansing from sin.

Only when the hand of God brings him to that desperate place will he beg for a “manifestation of God’s salvation to his soul.” This then is true salvation, not the casual decision to add Jesus to the rest of one’s interests, which occurs all too often these days.

An Earnest Warning about Lukewarmness
. He goes on to describe the grave danger of lukewarmness within the churches of Christ, warning, "When churches get into the condition of half-hearted faith, tolerating the gospel, but having a sweet tooth for error, they do far more mischief to their age than downright heretics." Spurgeon gives a clear admonition to believers of all times by urging them to have zeal and fervour for Christ rather than dead complacency.

Título: Election
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: In this sermon Spurgeon proves the doctrine of election from Scripture and cites several creeds in support. He shows that election is absolute, not depending upon what we are. It is a work of eternity, done before time began. And it is a personal work, of people, not of nations. It produces good results, holiness in the life of the believer. This doctrine strips away all of our pride and humbles us at the feet of a sovereign God of mercy. It gives us courage in the face of all opposition. Understood rightly, election gives great hope to the sinner, who is to focus not on election, but on Christ the Savior.

Título: Encouragement for Christian Mothers
Autor: James Cameron
Descrição: Encouragement for Christian Mothers
 exalts motherhood as a work that glorifies God and advances His kingdom, highlighting the eternal impact of a mother’s influence and giving helpful words of wisdom for the fulfilling of this great mission. While challenging mothers with the greatness and weight of their task, this booklet encourages Christian mothers to take heart because God Who has called them to this work is sufficient for all they need. In a day when motherhood is minimized and even despised, this booklet offers timeless encouragement for Christian mothers everywhere.
Encouragement for Christian Mothers
 is taken from his “Three Lectures to Christian Mothers,” which were first preached in his own congregation in the course of his ordinary pastoral instruction. Due to their effectiveness, the messages were preached again in Edinburgh at the request of women from several denominations. Although not originally intended for publication, the messages were eventually printed, and thus have been preserved for us today.

 challenges our complacency toward the issue of Bible translation by asking the very simple question: “By what standard” are we to judge the authority and reliability of translations of the Bible into modern languages? With clarity and brevity, William Einwechter shows that there are biblical criteria for judging the reliability of English translations. Therefore, the Christian is not at liberty to simply choose one that suits his fancy, and the church cannot be indifferent in the selection of a translation for public use. With the very integrity of God’s Word at stake, the conscientious believer cannot be pro-choice on the issue of Bible translations!

Título: Entering the Strait Gate by Faith Alone
Autor: Edward Fisher
Descrição: Entering the Strait Gate by Faith Alone 
is an excerpt from 
The Marrow of Modern Divinity
 by Edward Fisher (c.1612-c.1657). 
The Marrow
 influentially stated the doctrine of unconditional grace, advocating a free offer of the gospel without condition. It was at the center of the later Marrow Controversy.
 
Here Fisher gives a dialogue between a gospel minister and struggling souls to correct misconceptions regarding the Law, grace, and works. Fisher urges, "Come to Christ by believing that He will accept of you, justify, and save you freely by His grace, according to His gracious promise. This is neither pride nor presumption: for Christ having tendered and offered it to you freely, believe it, it is true humility of heart to take what Christ offers you."

Título: Escape For Your Life
Autor: Joel Beeke
Descrição: Comparing God’s September 11, 2001, judgment on America to His ancient judgment on Sodom, Joel Beeke examines heaven’s somber message to our sinful nation and, more personal, to those who have ignored or rejected the gospel. He addresses the latter in words spoken by the angel just prior to Sodom’s devastation, “Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed” (Gen. 19:17). From this passage he admonishes unbelievers:
 
 
Realize your danger (you are under the wrath of God, just like Sodom).
 
Forsake all (you must give up everything to follow Christ).
 
Run for your life (you must flee this wicked world).
 
 
Beeke sums it up this way, “Oh, I beseech you, run for your life; run straight to Christ. Don’t run to ceremonies, feelings, ministers, works, orthodoxies—but run straight to Christ.”

Título: Eternal Destiny of the Unsaved
Autor: I. C. Herendeen
Descrição: I. C. Herendeen examines the somber—and by today’s standards very unpopular—question of what happens to the unsaved after death. Why did he write on such a subject? Because an offended God is righteous, holy, and just. Because natural man is an incorrigible sinner with the wrath of a sin-hating God abiding on him. Because the sinner is in alarming danger; the punishment that awaits him is awful, hopeless, unendurable, and endless. In a word, Herendeen wrote to give sinners a solemn warning. He does this by expounding on the nature of hell, the sinner’s great folly, and the ferocity of God’s wrath. He concludes by explaining who goes to hell and why, and showing the only way of escape—“Flee to the blessed Saviour.”

Pink concludes his exposition of the judgment of God by giving an earnest warning to the unsaved reader to come into God’s eternal mercy and grace in Christ and be saved from the coming wrath of eternal punishment.

Even though many people will have nothing to do with God now, how many consider that they will certainly face Him then? The author challenges his unregenerate readers to contemplate the gravity of their vulnerable state, “Your sin will find you out,” he says, and pointedly asks “Where will you spend eternity?” Softening his tone, he urges them to “Listen to the glad tidings of God, against whom you have sinned.” In the end, he quotes John 3:16, explaining, “My dear friend, this is God’s salvation.” And poses the crucial question, “Will you take it?”

Descrição: The Everlasting Righteousness
 gets right to the heart of the gospel of Jesus Christ. How can sinful people be right before a holy God? God’s inflexible justice demands a perfect righteousness in His creatures; only the everlasting righteousness of the Son of God will suffice! His is sufficient because it is that of God Himself. When a sinner believes on Christ the Savior, his record of sins is erased on the basis of the substitutionary work of Christ on the cross, and Christ’s righteousness is freely reckoned to his account. This priceless gift is granted freely to the one who places his faith in the Person of Christ, not in his own merits, graces, or even faith itself. The sufficient righteousness of Christ is the safe ground of peace and joy for the believer, as he looks not at anything in himself but the all-sufficient Lamb of God!

Título: Excellence of the Authorized Version, The
Autor: William Einwechter
Descrição: “No other version of the Bible in English has ever equaled or even approached the influence, acceptance, and authority of the King James Version (KJV) among English-speaking peoples. The overall impact of the KJV during its 350-year reign as the standard English Bible is incalculable. As an accurate, authoritative translation of the original Hebrew and Greek texts of the Word of God, it has guided the English church into all truth, taught us the whole counsel of God, and stood as a bulwark against false teachers and their heresies…The purpose of this essay, therefore, is to take a look at the excellence of the AV and some of the factors that caused it to become the most authoritative and widely used English version ever.”—

Descrição: “Faith is called for, but take not every sort of faith for saving faith. It would make tender hearts bleed to see so many mistaken in the matter of their faith. There are some who say they had faith all their days—that they were convinced of the lamentable deceit and delusion they are under! Learn to distinguish between 
Faith 
and 
Fancy
, between historical and temporary faith, and true saving faith. Though historical and temporary faith are not delusions, yet in so far as you rest on the same, and mistake them for saving faith, you are deluded, for saving faith puts you out of yourselves to rest on Jesus Christ; it brings the soul from the covenant of works to a new holding of life by Christ and His righteousness.”

Título: Faith, Assurance, and Perseverance of the Saints
Autor: Ernest C. Reisinger
Descrição: Faith, Assurance, and Perseverance
 is a biblical explanation of five great doctrines of the Christian faith, including self-examination and the gospel in Christ. After developing each doctrine, each is examined in its relation to others in order to expand understanding and application. Faith and repentance, assurance and faith, self-examination and assurance, perseverance and assurance, perseverance and preservation—these and other relationships unfold the full meaning God has given us in the Scriptures. The author explains, “These five doctrines can be studied separately, but should never be studied independently of each other. They are vitally related and need each other in order to understand and establish all five of them.”

Título: The Faithfulness of God
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In this issue of the 
Free Grace Broadcaster
, we focus on “The Faithfulness of God.” A. W. Pink encourages the reader to look above the scenes of unfaithfulness in the world to the One Who is faithful in all things and at all times. Edward Pearse holds forth the staggering truth of God’s faithfulness being based upon His unchangeableness. Charles Bridges takes the reader to the Psalms to see that the LORD is faithful even in the affliction of His children. John Flavel assures the saints that God’s faithfulness is the believer’s security and city of refuge in a world of disappointments. Richard Sibbes follows by drawing on the thought that God is faithful in His nature, faithful in His Word, and faithful in His works. Thomas Manton shows forth God’s consistent faithfulness being put on display in every generation. Charles Simeon highlights God’s faithfulness in His inability to lie. Charles Spurgeon closes out the subject by exalting the Lord Jesus as the Amen of God in all His purposes and promises.

Título: Faithfulness of God, The
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: According to A. W. Pink, many in the church are ignorant of the scriptural meaning of foreknowledge. Because of this ignorance, it is easy for unlearned teachers to spread erroneous doctrine. A common error is the following: in opposition to the clear teaching of Scripture that God sovereignly chose certain people for salvation, these teachers argue that God, in His “foreknowledge,” looked into the future and saw that certain people would believe—and so predestined them to salvation. This turns Scripture on its head, making man the final arbiter of his salvation rather than God. In repudiating this error, Pink explains the true meaning of foreknowledge as taught in Scripture, showing that it is “never used in connection with events or actions, but always refers to persons.” It is individual people that God is said to foreknow, not the actions of those people.

Descrição: "One...cause of the decay of religion in our day...is the neglect of the worship of God in families." The articles in this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster are designed to instruct and motivate heads of households to diligently pursue their duties in teaching their families the Word of God. We are reminded of the history of family worship in the Bible and church history. God is the founder, owner, master, and benefactor of families; and therefore, families should pray to Him. We have many motives and reasons provided to lead us to this glorious work. Family worship includes reading God's Word and praying together. The responsibility of family worship rests on the father, though mothers also have a responsiblity if the man is absent. John G. Paton provides a touching illustration of family worship from his Scottish boyhood home and from his missionary endeavors in the South Sea Islands. Implementing family worship needs a clear plan or strategy. Joel Beeke gives us this in helpful directions for how to put this into practice.

Descrição: This sermon was “preached at the first precinct at Northampton after the people’s public rejection of their minister and renouncing their relation to him as pastor of the church there, on June 22, 1750.” How this rejection came about is not the focus in his last message to his beloved congregation, but rather 
how the pastor and congregation must relate to each other
, both during their time as congregants and when they meet at the Last Judgment, when all things will be known! In this, it is wonderfully instructive for churches everywhere.

Título: Fatherhood
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: Matthew Henry said, “Masters of families, who preside in the other affairs of the house, must go before their households in the things of God. They must be as prophets, priests, and kings in their own families; and as such they must keep up family-doctrine, family-worship, and family-discipline.” The master of a family in Henry’s time was the male head of a household—usually a husband or father. The Reformers and Puritans often spoke of fathers this way. The biblical vision of fatherhood that arises from the pages of Scripture is beautiful, majestic, and holy. It is also foreign to the day in which we live.
 
As Henry points out, fathers “must go before their households in the things of God.” The biblical picture of a father is of one who leads his family according to the Word of God. He is a representative of God and Christ. This means that he must be a man of prayer, of the Word, and of humble holiness. By faith in Christ, trusting in His grace, empowered by His Spirit, and informed by the Word, a father must keep up “family doctrine.” This means he should be able to teach his family the truths of God’s Word. He must keep up “family worship.” His home must be a place where he leads his loved ones in the worship of the thrice-holy Triune God, in prayer, in the reading of Scripture, and in song. And he must keep up “family discipline.” That is, he must govern his home under Christ, blessing the obedient and chastening the disobedient—all under the grace, mercy, and love of Jesus Christ the Lord. He must learn from Christ, walk with Christ, and model Christ’s truth in his home.
 
Do we understand fatherhood this way? Along with many other biblical doctrines, the biblical doctrine of fatherhood has fallen on hard times. Our decaying and perverse culture needs a mighty generation of biblical fathers to rise up from the ashes of authoritarianism, abdicationism, selfism, feminism, and same-sex-ism to follow Christ, whatever the cost.
 
With this in mind, we offer the latest issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster, 
Fatherhood. 
William Gurnall briefly introduces us to this subject by describing a father’s roles as a 
prophet
 to instruct the family, a 
king
 to govern the family, and a 
priest
 to lead the family in the worship of God. Arthur W. Pink then helps us understand that fatherhood is a responsibility and a privilege, as a father instructs his children, models the Christian life for them, disciplines them, and prays for them. John Calvin explains a father’s main responsibility. Richard Baxter writes that, in order to properly lead a family for Christ, a father must understand and maintain biblical authority in his home, skill in governing, and holiness of life. We then learn from Nicholas Byfield that a father must be godly. What does this look like? Byfield tells us by giving us a list of signs by which fathers may identify Christ’s work in their hearts. To be a “prophet” in his home, a father must teach the Word of God, says Thomas Doolittle; and to be effectual in that good work, he, as a “priest,” must be a man of prayer. Every father knows that bringing up children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord is a difficult task; for this reason, William Gouge discusses the loving discipline that a father must exercise as “king” in his home. However, Thomas Watson makes abundantly clear that fathers must act prudently toward their children: otherwise, they can provoke them to wrath. Having considered all this, what practical steps can a man take to accomplish it? Richard Baxter gives clear, helpful, biblical counsel to fathers who would reform their families in the name of Jesus Christ. Finally, George Swinnock concludes this subject with an earnest, heartfelt prayer to be the father that Christ has saved him to be.
 
If you find these articles biblical and useful, then please join us in praying that God the Father will be pleased through the Person and work of His Son and the power of His Holy Spirit to raise up a ...

Título: Fear of God, The
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: The Word of God tells us, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom" (Pro 9:10). This is strange language to the ears of the world. Unfortunately, it also seems to be strange to many of God's children. No doubt there are many reasons for this; but standing at the head of the line is that sobering reality that 
nothing 
deprives us of our joys and pleasures like fear. Edmund Burke said, "No passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as fear."
 
Fear...strength withers in its presence. Happiness flees. It's a fact woven into the fabric of our daily lives. This is why we often think of fear only in that dreadful sense of anxiety when we face the presence of danger...So we usually conclude that fear is to be avoided at all costs.
 
Yet the Bible tells us the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Christians often misunderstand what the fear of God is. How are we to understand this? How can we fear God and love Him at the same time? This issue of the Broadcaster attempts to answer these questions and to bring some clarity to this most important subject. From A.W. Pink's and Charles Bridges' short and helpful articles to the lengthier discourses by A'Brakel, Gill, Bunyan, and Spurgeon, there is a clear Biblical unfolding of this glorious theme. Our prayer is that you will find much help and edification as you digest each of these blessed articles.

Descrição: In this sermon on Galatians 5:22, Spurgeon looks at the first of the fruits of the Spirit, which is love. He compares the love the Spirit brings to four things. First, it is like a winnowing fan blowing away the excesses of our lusts and self-indulgence. Second, it is like a priceless jewel, incalculable in value. Third, it is a rich and rare picture painted by a Master, the great designer of all things beautiful. Lastly, Spirit-wrought love is likened to a crown to give glory to God the Spirit alone for His work in our hearts.

Título: Five Facts Every Christian Should Know
Autor: C.R. Martin
Descrição: This tract is a concise exposition of the five components of the “Golden Chain” found in Rom. 8:29-30. In this passage the Apostle Paul declares that God foreknows, predestines, calls, justifies, and glorifies every true Christian. The chain cannot be broken. If God does one of these things, He does them all. And if He does them all, then every person that He foreknows He will surely glorify. This should give believers great encouragement and hope for the future. As the author says, “Whereas these facts have to do with your personal and eternal salvation, none of them depend upon you for their fulfillment, but were determined long before you ever existed and are according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace (Eph. 1:5-6).

Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: In his unique style, J. C. Ryle examines the important issue of idolatry. He elaborates on several of its aspects including: what idolatry is, its cause, and the forms it takes—noting especially the “huge organized idolatry” of Romanism. He indicates that in the end all idolatry will be destroyed at the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. At that time, we will see a great harvest and a perfect church without spot or wrinkle, but until then the wheat and tares will grow together. Ryle concludes by showing how, in the meantime, we as believers may be safe from idolatry by maintaining continual communion with the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, by arming ourselves with the Word of God, and by holding sound views of our Lord and the salvation that is found in Him.

Título: Fleeing Out of Sodom
Autor: Jonathan Edwards
Descrição: In this sermon, Jonathan Edwards gives a number of reasons why the story of Lot’s fleeing out of Sodom is a picture of fleeing to Christ from the state of sin and misery. He notes that those who flee ought not to look back. Sodom is a city full of filthiness and abominations with nothing worth looking back upon, and it is a city appointed to swift and sudden destruction—a destruction that will be exceedingly dreadful, universal, and everlasting. Edwards solemnly warns those who are in a “natural condition” to flee, pointing out that the world is divided into two cities—the holy and beloved city of Zion, and the polluted and accursed city of Sodom. He underscores the gravity of his warning with this chilling truth: He who is out of Christ is in Sodom.

Título: For Whom Did Christ Die?
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Charles Spurgeon asks a very important question: for whom did Christ die? The straight-forward answer is given in Romans 5:6—
for the ungodly
. Expanding on this truth, he first lays out the hopeless condition of the ungodly, moving from there to the truth that Christ died for sinners just like them, and on to the plain inferences that may be drawn from this. For the ungodly these inferences are twofold. First, they are already under God’s wrath and in great danger. Second, only Christ can deliver them out of this danger and only through His death. Spurgeon concludes by addressing the believers in his congregation, urging them to make the truth of Romans 5:6 the central message of their lives. Turning to the unsaved, his plea is simple: “There is life in a look at the crucified One…look to Him now and live.”

Título: Foreknowledge of God  (in election)
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: According to A. W. Pink, many in the church are ignorant of the Scriptural meaning of foreknowledge. Because of this ignorance, it is easy for unlearned teachers to spread erroneous doctrine. The most common error is the following: in opposition to the clear teaching of Scripture that God sovereignly chose certain people for salvation, these teachers argue that God, in His “foreknowledge,” looked into the future and saw that certain people would believe—and so predestined them to salvation. This turns Scripture on its head, making man the final arbiter of his salvation rather than God. In repudiating this error, Pink explains the true meaning of foreknowledge as taught in Scripture, showing that it is “never used in connection with events or actions, but always refers to persons.” It is individual people that God is said to foreknow, not the actions of those people.

Título: Forgiveness
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: Who needs forgiveness and why? According to J. C. Ryle, the short answer is that all men need forgiveness because all are sinners. He elaborates on this at some length and then offers a concise summary, “The first step towards heaven is to see clearly that we 
deserve hell
. There are but two alternatives before us: we must either be forgiven, or be miserable forever.” He next addresses the question of 
how
 we are forgiven. Speaking directly to the unsaved, he implores them, “Cast your soul, with all its sins, unreservedly on Christ; cease completely from any dependence on your own works.” After describing several characteristics of those who have been forgiven—they hate sin, they love Christ, they are humble, holy, and forgiving—Ryle ends with a solemn warning to those who know they are not forgiven, and a word of exhortation to those who are.

The cross of Christ provides us the only basis of this forgiveness. Those who have been forgiven will follow their Savior in forgiving others who do them wrong.

Título: Formality
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: J. C. Ryle here presents a comparison of “formal religion” and true religion. Based on 2 Timothy 3:5 and Romans 2:28-29, he indicates that we may learn three basic lessons as we study these two texts. In the first place, we learn that formal religion (that which is based on outward manifestations only) is not true religion and that a formal Christian is not a Christian in God’s sight. Secondly, we learn that the heart is the seat of true religion and that the true Christian is the Christian in heart. Thirdly, we learn that true religion must never expect to be popular—it will not have the “praise of man, but of God.” Ryle ends by addressing three types of people—formal Christians, those under conviction of sin, and true believers—offering wise counsel to each.

Título: Fountain of Life Opened, The (An Excerpt)

Descrição: The Fountain of Life Opened
 is one of John Flavel’s best known works, subtitled 
A Display of Christ in His Essential and Mediatorial Glory.
 Against the backdrop of the sinful state of man and the effects of Adam’s fall, Flavel traces with skillful application the doctrines of Christ’s essential glory, the covenant of redemption, His impeccability, His prophetical, priestly, and kingly offices, and His death, resurrection, ascension, and heavenly session. In a letter to a friend, A. W. Pink once wrote, “
Fountain of Life
 is my favorite of [Flavel’s] works and I recently read the whole of it to my wife—one chapter each evening.” This booklet is an excerpt of one section, “The Kingly Office of Christ as Providentially Executed for the Redeemed,” which wonderfully proclaims Christ’s rule on behalf of His people in this day.

Título: Fourfold Salvation, A
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this short booklet, A. W. Pink gives a clear and uncomplicated explanation of God's salvation. After noting that this subject has provoked age-long controversy among professing Christians, he assures us that “every genuine Christian 
has been
 saved, 
is now being
 saved, and 
will yet be
 saved.” Under four headings he delves into the four aspects of salvation: salvation from the pleasure of sin (regeneration), from the penalty of sin (justification), from the power of sin (sanctification), and from the presence of sin (glorification). In summary, Pink shows that God’s sovereign work of salvation spans eternity and time, stretching from election in eternity past, to justification and struggle with indwelling sin in this life, and culminating in a merciful end to the struggle as we leave this earth for our eternal home in heaven—never to see or experience sin again.

Título: Free Will - A Slave
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Charles Spurgeon examines John 5:40 in this sermon on free will, explaining that the text is “one of the great guns of the Arminians,” but he intends to turn the gun back on them, for “it was never theirs.” He goes on to elaborate on four points—men are by nature dead, in Christ Jesus there is life, eternal life is given to all who come for it, and—the final, crucial point—by nature no man will come to Christ. So it follows that any man who does come will know by his very coming that he has been chosen and enabled by God’s saving grace. Spurgeon winds up his sermon as follows: “This morning I have not preached human nature up, but I have preached it down.” And when man is humbled, God is glorified!

The Judgment Day is coming; "the burning up of this earth and the passing away of these heavens is an event in the history of God's administration to which we are continually drawing nearer." But fury is not yet in God; it is not yet to be unleashed. God in His mercy has stretched forth "mighty strength that had to be put forth in the work of a sinner's justification."

He deduces from this that the Israel of God may for a time be vanquished and defeated by troops of enemies; yet they shall be victorious at last.

Título: Glorious Institution: The Church in History (1&2: AD100-1516)
Autor: Stanford Murrell
Descrição: A Glorious Institution: The Church in History, Parts One and Two
 is the first volume of the four part series encompassing the breadth of Church history from its beginnings to the present day.
 
Part One:
 
When the Church Was Young AD 33-754
 focuses on the early growth of the Christian Church, developing from a small assembly of believers in Jerusalem to become a vast spiritual kingdom touching the lives of millions in many lands. Under the influence of Church Fathers and councils, carefully worded creeds guided the core doctrines of Christianity. The saints were persecuted at the hands of Jews and then Gentiles, but the Church miraculously survived to fulfill the Great Commission for its day.
 
Part Two:
 
The Church in the Middle Ages AD 754-1517 
traces the days of Charlemagne to the dawn of the Reformation. Popes and Emperors maneuvered for church power, bringing division into East and West, control by civil governments, and great wealth. The Crusades brought contact with the rich civilizations of the East. New ways of thinking swept in the Renaissance. Pagan culture mixed with Christian truth, resulting in new persecution from within and urgent cry for reform.

, 
Parts Three and Four 
is the second volume of the four part series which encompasses the breadth of Church history from its beginnings up to the present day.
 
Part Three: The Reformation and Its Aftermath 1517-1648
 observes the tremendous upheaval when brave men were transforming the spiritual Church into conformity with God’s inerrant Word, in deliberate departure from the traditions of men. We see Luther’s increasing conviction in Germany, then Zwingli, Calvin, and Farel in Switzerland—at great personal cost. We see the spreading flame of reformation come to France, the Netherlands, Scotland, and England, including incredible struggle for supremacy between popes, monarchs, and ideas. We see the rise of different Protestant denominations as men struggled to understand the clear teachings of Scripture.
 
In 
Part Four: The Church in the Modern Age 1648-1900s
, we see the difficulty men have when given freedom to study the Scriptures, to avoid false doctrines springing out of pride and greed. Nevertheless, “our God reigns!”—there were Great Awakenings as the Holy Spirit revived true Christianity repeatedly and brought evangelical missions movements worldwide. Though it faces real challenges, the Church Triumphant continues to grow as a blessing to the world.

Título: Glory of Christ, The 
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: John Owen said, “No man shall ever behold the glory of Christ by sight in heaven who does not, in some measure, behold it by faith in this world.” Furthermore, Octavius Winslow puts it this way: “If a man sees not the glory of Christ, we hesitate not to say of him that with regard to all other spiritual objects, he is totally blind—he is yet a stranger to the illuminating grace of the Holy Spirit.” What do you think of those statements? Be honest. Do you agree with them? Or do you think them an aberration, an exaggeration…maybe a form of mysticism? Owen goes on to say, “Let no one deceive himself. He that has no sight of Christ’s glory here shall never see it hereafter.” Really? Thankfully, he explains himself: “The beholding of Christ in glory is too high, glorious, and marvelous for us in our present condition. The splendor of Christ’s glory is too much for our physical eyes just as is the sun shining in all its strength. So, while we are here on earth, we can behold His glory only by faith.” So, he is not talking about dreams or visions. Rather, he says in his famous work, 
Meditations and Discourses on the Glory of Christ, in His Person, Office, and Grace: with the Differences between Faith and Sight Applied unto the Use of Them That Believe
—or simply, 
The Glory of Christ
—that we can only see Christ’s glory in the Scriptures, preeminently in the gospel, through faith quickened by the Holy Spirit. When I first read Owen’s book, I confess that I was surprised, challenged, reproved, corrected, edified, and transformed. And, after prayer and contemplation, I realized that Owen’s point was simple, profound, and much neglected by modern Christianity. Friend, do you 
see
 the glory of Christ?
 
We read Owen in our Chapel Library staff prayer meeting, and with hearts humbled by God’s transforming truth, souls warmed with biblical glimpses of the Sun of Righteousness, affections moved by the stunning beauty of the Savior, and lives transformed by seeing Him Who loved us from all eternity, we offer you this Free Grace Broadcaster: 
The Glory of Christ. 
John Owen introduces us to this vital subject by explaining the great privilege of seeing Christ’s glory in 
this
 world as preparation for seeing His eternal splendor and majesty in the 
next
. Following this, Owen briefly explains that the glory of Christ is the glory of the 
person
 of Christ. Charles Spurgeon then helps us to glimpse that glory with a remarkable and concise panorama of Christ’s love, His incarnation, His atoning sacrifice, His resurrection, His enthronement, and His second coming! Oh, what a vision it is! Octavius Winslow then declares that there is no love like Christ’s—a revealing love, a condescending love, a self-sacrificing love, and a forgiving love. John Flavel skillfully reveals the glory of Christ in His offices as our Prophet, our Priest, and our King. Then, William Plumer gives us yet another panoramic look at Christ; but this time in His humiliation, that is, His obedient submission to His Father in His earthly life—from virgin conception to His suffering and agony on Calvary’s cross. From there, Spurgeon declares to us that Christ’s crucifixion is Christ’s glory! He presents the revelation of Christ lifted up, drawing sinners to Himself in the greatest love ever manifested in this depraved world. But Christ’s story and glory do not end there: Thomas Watson shows us that God the Father exalted His Son in His titles, His office, His ascension, His session at God’s right hand, and His judging of the world! If we really see Christ so, our hearts cannot but be ravished by His beauty; and Octavius Winslow proclaims that there is no beauty like Christ’s beauty—nothing in the universe compares! Winslow then brings this theme to a close by challenging us to 
contemplate
 Christ’s astonishing glory.

They went sad and lonely from the grave of their Master to the bosom of their Lord, and buried their sorrow in His loving, sympathizing heart. Imitate their Christ-honoring example. Ere you take counsel of man or ask sympathy of friendship, ere you confer and communicate with the dearest and nearest earthly friend—go and tell Jesus. Thus confiding in Him, He will return your confidence a thousandfold!”     –

Título: God-breathed Scripture
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: Charles Spurgeon said of the Scriptures, “This volume is the writing of the living God: each letter was penned with an Almighty finger; each word in it dropped from the everlasting lips, each sentence was dictated by the Holy Spirit.” This was once 
the
 bedrock doctrine of biblical Christianity. It lay at the heart of the Protestant Reformation, which many are remembering this year. That extraordinary event was not merely about the correct view of justification, the true worship of God, or the reformation of marriage and family. Underlying all this was the most important question for all people at all times to answer: “What is our final authority?” Without an authoritative revelation from God, we have no object for our faith. The inspired, infallible Word of God is our final authority for all of life. As stated in the Second London Baptist Confession of 1689, “The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience” (1.1).
 
Unfortunately, few professing Christians believe this anymore. So, with this thought, we present the first FGB of 2017: 
God-breathed Scripture
. Arthur W. Pink introduces this vital subject with thoughts on the impregnable rock of Scripture and its divine inspiration. Louis Gaussen then helps us understand what “inspiration” really means. In a day when poets and musicians are considered to offer “inspired” performances, we need a clear grasp of this mysterious act of God. What then is 
verbal
 inspiration? David Martyn Lloyd-Jones explains this important doctrine, which many professing Christians have abandoned. Thomas Boston then gives a concise description of the contents of the canon of Scripture and tells us how the Apocrypha relates to it. Charles Hodge gives insight into the infallibility and authority of God’s words, while Benjamin B. Warfield reveals that Jesus believed and taught that the Scriptures were God-breathed and authoritative. And then a question: which has ultimate authority—a religious organization or Scripture? Wilhelmus à Brakel answers this, and lists divine characteristics that prove the Bible authoritative. Octavius Winslow agrees that creation reveals the existence of God, but only the Bible tells us how God saves through the person and work of Jesus Christ. In a second article, Thomas Boston acknowledges that Scripture is not always easy to understand, yet everything sinners need to know for the salvation of their eternal souls 
is
 clear. Though the Bible gives abundant evidence of its divine origin, why does anyone truly believe it is God’s Word? John Murray answers, “The witness of the Holy Spirit in the human heart.” Finally, Charles Spurgeon reaffirms that, in Scripture, God speaks; and for that very reason, we should give our earnest attention to every word of it.
 
As we begin this new year, our hearts’ desire is to encourage you to love, believe, obey, and commune with the Living God through His inspired Word. Study it for yourself, teach it to your children, preach it to the lost, and send it around the world!

Título: Godhood of God
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: A. W. Pink begins in his usual forthright manner by defining the Godhood of God. He puts it this way: God is omnipotent and absolutely sovereign, doing according to His will in heaven and on earth where none can stay His hand. In short, Pink asserts that God 
is
 God. Referring to a popular but false view of God, he affirms that God is 
much more
 than one who has given man the power of choice and consequently cannot compel man to do His bidding. Pink goes on to describe the true God of Scripture, pointing out how God’s ways are infinitely higher than ours. He concludes with an exhortation to the reader: “This is the first lesson we have to learn: that God is the creator, we the creature; that He is the Potter, we the clay.” According to Pink, this is also a lesson we must continually re-learn.

Título: God's Decrees
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: God’s decrees gave rise to creation, providence, and redemption. Before the foundation of the world, this omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent sovereign Lord decreed an unchangeable, eternal plan for everything and everyone He would bring into existence. He purposed to create an astonishing universe that included a magnificent world that would be the habitation of His image-bearers. Not only would He create this glorious theater, He would unfold throughout its ages an extraordinary plan of redemption. He is, therefore, the holy Sovereign of all existing things, people, and events. This issue of the FGB is a companion to the previous one, 
God’s Eternal Purpose
. However, 
God’s Decrees
 introduces a number of profound biblical doctrines between its covers; we hope to explore these in greater detail in future issues—the sovereignty of God, predestination, election and reprobation, creation, and providence. Dear pastors, preach these themes to God’s hungry sheep; it will do them much good, especially in the days ahead; and it will bring much glory to God. Parents, ground your children in these soul-anchoring truths. They will need them.

Título: God's Eternal Purpose
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In his classic work, 
The Economy of the Covenants between God and Man, 
Herman Witsius (1636-1708) made the following statement: “The covenant between the Father and the Son is the foundation of the whole of our salvation.” ...Do we realize that everything Christ did in history was planned in eternity?
 
So, what do we call this “eternal purpose”? ...The Word of God says that the unsearchable riches of God’s grace and His manifold wisdom are displayed, “according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Eph 3:11). This and many other passages are why Witsius and others believed then and still believe today that an eternal agreement between the Father and Son is plainly set forth in the infallible Word of God. For instance: “This is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing” (Joh 6:39).
 
To encourage God’s people to think deeply about these matters, we present this issue of the FGB, 
God’s Eternal Purpose...
David Martyn Lloyd-Jones introduces this deeply profound subject. Charles Spurgeon then beautifully, movingly explains the parties, stipulations, and objects of God’s eternal counsels. What is the nature of this eternal agreement? Patrick Gillespie describes it, and Peter Bulkeley offers a brief list of the promises and agreements exchanged between the Father and the Son in eternity. The biblical reality of God’s plan is explored by R. B. C. Howell, and A. W. Pink shows the importance of Christ’s election as our Mediator. Now, is this all speculation, or is there any practical value to the contemplation of this subject? Thomas Brooks answers that question with a detailed exposition of the agreements between Father and Son, aimed at the edification and encouragement of believers. A. A. Hodge helps us to see that the only way to understand Christ’s atonement properly is through the lens of God’s eternal purpose. And then, Spurgeon, in a second article, gives us a breathtaking vision of the consummation of God’s plan—the marriage of the Lamb. Finally, Isaac Ambrose urges us to a deep love for Christ because He planned and agreed to be our Savior before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah! What a Savior!

Título: God's Love
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In the hope of doing some good to God’s eternally-loved children, we present this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster: 
God’s Love
. Octavius Winslow, a man whose writings are steeped in the love of God, introduces us to God’s glorious attribute of love. Arthur Pink then reveals the extraordinary nature of God’s infinite love for His people. Puritan Thomas Manton shows us that first God loved His eternal Son in eternity, then, He loved His people in Christ, and now He loves Christ in His people. Do we have a good grasp of how that love comes from eternity into history? Thomas Reade helps us to see this in Christ Jesus. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones shows us that God manifests His love in many ways; but the clearest, highest, and most beautiful way is in the person and work of Jesus Christ our Lord. How does a Christian live in this world of sorrow, heartaches, troubles, and misery? In a second article, Winslow tells us that we should trust God’s love for us in every providence. Samuel Eyles Pierce wants us to ponder deeply the Apostle John’s command to 
behold 
the wonderful love God had for us in eternity, has for us now, and will have forever. Few people can preach about God’s love with the authority, tenderness, and clarity of Charles Spurgeon. He sets before us God’s immeasurable love in His eternally loved Son for His eternally loved people. And Winslow has the final word: having given a biblical exposition of God’s mighty love in Christ, in this last article, he soberly tells what happens when God’s love turns to anger.
 
Drink in what the Scriptures truly teach about God and His love in the words of these faithful preachers. Gaze upon the love that is so high, so wide, so deep that it transforms the human soul forever. Contemplate the mighty, eternal, full, and free love of God in Christ, and love Him back by repenting of your sins, by looking in faith to Christ, and by humbly obeying Him. He is worthy because He 
is
 love, and He loves His people in Christ.

Título: God's Providence
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: In this booklet, Charles Spurgeon examines the biblical doctrine of God’s providence. He first considers the minuteness of providence, noting that most people have no trouble seeing God’s providence in the great things, but few can appreciate His working in the very smallest things—even though the two cannot be separated. He points out in the second place that God’s providence is His “kind consideration in taking care of His people.” He concludes with a three-fold application: understanding God’s providence should make us bold and fearless, should give us comfort in the loss of loved ones, and should keep our reaction to the ups and downs of life in balance.

Título: God's Purpose of Grace
Autor: Horatius Bonar
Descrição: God’s Purpose of Grace magnifies the grace of God in its fullness and blessedness, for both the seasoned saint and the seeker. Grace is all the more glorious in light of man’s tremendous need, without hope and without God in this world. But this need, with no merit in ourselves, is but the opening for God to pour forth His grace freely and abundantly. God’s love and justice in shedding the lifeblood of His only Son and His holiness in honoring His law are but aspects of the beauty of His grace. Bonar concludes with a clear presentation of gospel grace and how those without Christ may be joined to Him by grace through faith alone.

Descrição: In this short tract, A. W. Pink explains the biblical and foundational doctrine of God’s sovereignty, noting that there is no doctrine more comforting to God’s children and no doctrine more hated by the world. Indeed, men of the world will allow God to be everywhere except on His throne. Pink goes on to point out a long line of examples from Scripture in which the sovereignty of God is put on open display. He ends with this: “Here, then, is the highest and grandest display of the absolute sovereignty of God. Verily, He has ‘mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth’ (Rom 9:18).”

Título: God's Way of Holiness

Descrição: “The way of peace and the way of holiness lie side by side, or rather, they are one. That which bestows the one imparts the other; and he who takes the one takes the other also. The Spirit of peace is the Spirit of holiness. The God of peace is the God of holiness. If at any time these paths seem to go asunder, there must be something wrong—wrong in the teaching that makes them seem to part company, or wrong in the state of the man in whose life they have done so. They start together, or at least so nearly together that no eye, save the divine, can mark a difference…The two are not independent. There is fellowship between them, vital fellowship, each being the helpmeet of the other…A spurious holiness there may be, founded upon a spurious peace, or upon no peace at all; but true holiness must start from a true and authentic peace.”                                                —

, Horatius Bonar gives a clear understanding of the gospel as proclaimed by Christ and the apostles, while correcting some of the distortions that can destroy its message and confuse the seeking soul. He says, “Some have tried to give directions to sinners ‘how to get converted,’ multiplying words without wisdom, leading the sinner away from the Cross, by setting him upon 
doing
, not upon 
believing
. Our business is not to give any such directions, but, as the apostles did, to preach Christ crucified, a present Saviour, and a present salvation. Then it is that sinners are converted, as the Lord Himself said, ‘I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me’ (John 12:32).”

Título: God's Will, Man's Will, and Free Will
Autor: Ernest C. Reisinger
Descrição: From the Introduction:
 “Does salvation depend upon man’s willingness to be saved apart from a prior work of the Holy Spirit? We will see that no one is saved against his will; however, God changes the “willer” so as to make the sinner willing. We will see that the subject of free will is at the very heart of Christianity and has a profound effect on our message and method of evangelism. We will see that “whosoever will may come.” We will see that the Bible teaches that salvation depends not on man’s willingness but on God’s willingness, God’s grace, and God’s power—and if God did not have power over man’s will the whole world would go to hell. We will see that God does not exclude anyone in His invitations; however, sinners do exclude themselves.”

Descrição: God’s wrath is not a popular subject in much of today’s church. Introducing the theme of this booklet, Pastor Lee Roy Shelton states: “I believe that one of the grave errors of our day is the preaching of the love of God at the expense of His wrath and justice.” He develops this theme in four sections including: an explanation of God’s wrath as one of His divine attributes, a description of eternal punishment as the destiny of the wicked, a discussion of why God must punish sin, and what Christ says about God’s wrath. Shelton concludes with a description of the unbeliever’s perilous condition—he is condemned already, God’s sword is ready to come down at any moment, and God has made no promise to stay His hand. The remedy? “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.” Acts 16:31.

Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: A. W. Pink has loaded this uplifting tract with numerous insights into the goodness of God. Below are a few highlights to whet the reader’s appetite.
 
 
 
The goodness of God refers to the perfection of His nature.
 
He is originally good, good of Himself, and the highest good.
 
All that emanates from God—His decrees, creation, laws, and providence—cannot be anything but good.
 
His goodness is seen in that when man first sinned, a dispensation of unmixed wrath did not immediately begin.
 
God’s goodness appeared most brightly when He sent forth His Son for the salvation of His people.
 
Gratitude is the return justly required from the recipients of His benefits.
 
The goodness of God is the life of the believer’s trust.
 
 
 
Finally, Pink quotes Charles Spurgeon: “We must never tolerate an instant’s unbelief as to the goodness of the Lord.”

Autor: James A. Haldane
Descrição: In this tract, James Haldane elaborates on five major points concerning the gospel. First, the gospel is good news of pardon to the guilty. Second, the gospel is misunderstood by many who profess to believe, who view it as a “scheme for making up their deficiencies through the merits of Christ,” but this, he says, is “another gospel.” Third, to many who hear the gospel, it is foolishness and a stumbling block, an offense to their pride and they reject it. Fourth, while the gospel is a “proclamation of pardon addressed to sinners without exception…it is the power of God unto salvation only to those who believe,” whose hearts are purified by faith. Fifth, he warns that all who claim to be saved, but do not live soberly and righteously in this present world, and show no fruit, prove their salvation is a delusion.

Título: Grace of God, The
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this tract, Pink begins his exposition of the grace of God by emphasizing that it is “a perfection of the Divine character which is exercised only toward the elect.” He goes on to point out that there are three principle characteristics of divine grace. First it is eternal—planned and purposed in eternity before it is imparted in time. Second it is free, for nothing could ever purchase it. Third it is sovereign, because God bestows it upon whom He pleases. Furthermore, all three Persons of the Trinity are involved: God the Father is the Fountain of all grace, God the Son is the only Channel, and the Holy Spirit is the Bestower. Finally, it is a provision for men who are so fallen, corrupt, averse to God, blind, deaf, and “so dead that God Himself must open their graves and lift them into resurrection”!

Título: Greasy the Robber: A Story of Gospel's Power
Autor: Charles Lukesh
Descrição: Greasy the Robber
 is the true story of a thief and murderer in Siberia of the late 1800s. It is a story of the power of the Gospel: Jesus Christ saves sinners for the glory of His Name!
 
“When Pasha saw that these men were not from the barracks, he told them freely what he had passed through and where he wanted to go. The men listened attentively; the clever and daring boy appealed to them. After a short consultation, they decided to take him along with them, ‘that he may not perish,’ they said. Pasha dared not contradict them, because he feared these armed men. He went with them into the interior of the woods—now it became clear to Pasha that he had landed in a robbers’ den.”—
from Chapter 4, “Discovered”

Título: Great Judgment, The
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: The final judgment is a foundational doctrine of Christianity, and one of the most solemn. In this booklet, Charles Spurgeon sheds scriptural light on several of its aspects. Introducing his subject, he shows that the great judgment follows immediately after the resurrection of the dead so that they may be judged in their bodies. He goes on to indicate in the first place that no one escapes this final accounting, for every person who has ever lived will be judged; secondly, that the judge is none other than Jesus Christ Himself; thirdly, that the basis of judgment consists of those things done in the body; and finally, he describes the outcome—“the Lord will grant unto His people an abundant reward for all that they have done” and unto the ungodly the eternal punishment due to their sinful deeds. Spurgeon is quick to point out that the righteous do not deserve any reward, but that “God first gave them grace to do good works, then took their good works as evidence of a renewed heart, and then gave them a reward for what they had done.” He sums it all up this way, “…sin is hell and holiness is heaven.” And ends with an impassioned plea, “Oh, that we may have grace, every one of us, to flee to Christ. There is our only safety.”

Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: “Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.” With this quote from Job 5:7, A. W. Pink considers that there are two lines of truth concerning trouble and suffering in a Christian’s life. First, there are times when God chastens His children because of their sin. Second, trouble can be sent by God for benefits besides reproof of sin—for example, His purpose can be to make His people more like Christ, or fit them for greater usefulness in Christian service. The suffering believer should seek Divine consolation in the midst of all his trouble, confessing and forsaking every known sin. Whatever God does, it is for His glory and His people’s good.

For to those who have faith in God, Erskine asserts: "It  is  as  if  he  had  said, 'If  anything  trouble  you concerning  yourselves,  or  any  other  of  my  children,  directly  or  indirectly,  so  as  you  are  puzzled  and difficulted  therewith,  then  come  and  put  the  question  to  me,  and  I  will  satisfy  you;  and  if  you  would have  anything  done  for  you,  or  any  of  my  children,  come  and  put  it  upon  me,  and  put  me  to  it,  as confidently  as  if  you  could  command  me.'

Here Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) explains the beauty of "charity," or Christian love, as it will be expressed in the world to come. Heaven will be a world of love! God's love will fill us with love for Him and for His people, who will then be lovely in holiness and glory. The mutual love between God and His people, and each one of His people with each other, will be perfect and full. The glory of heaven will not be a little glittering gold but rather a community of saints given to loving God and each other in holy perfection!

Título: Heavenly Birth and Its Earthly Counterfeits
Autor: Joseph Charles Philpot
Descrição: In this 1843 sermon based on John 1:11-13, J. C. Philpot examines why some reject Christ and others receive Him. He further describes those who become sons of God and those who only profess to be sons of God. Explaining that the primary cause underlying all of this is found in the sovereign will of God, Philpot points out that there are also a number of secondary causes. For example, those who reject Christ do so because of blindness of heart, self-righteousness, worldliness of mind, or unbelief. In addition, he explores the motives of those who falsely profess a heavenly birth under three headings taken from John 1:13—born of blood, born of the will of the flesh, and born of the will of man. Philpot concludes with a description of those who are truly born of God.

Título: Heavenly Footman, The
Autor: John Bunyan
Descrição: The Heavenly Footman
 is a fast-paced and direct challenge to every Christian to “run the race to win”! 
Footman
 is no reference to an infantryman or an aristocrat’s servant, but refers to those who are travelling on foot to a distant country, engaged in a pilgrimage from earth to heaven.  John Bunyan uses the allegory of the runner to picture the Christian’s race through this world to win the heavenly prize. Indeed, they that will have heaven must run for it. “They which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize…so run, that ye may obtain” (1Co 9:24). He understands that most are too casual in their approach to the Christian life. Their vigilance looks more like sloth too much of the time! Instead, Bunyan encourages us to “press toward the mark,” to “continue in the faith” in spite of all adversity, to remove hindrances, to beware of by-paths, to know the cross and mortification, to deny self, and to persevere. While this race is mentioned in most works on holiness, Bunyan’s focus is on the personal vigilance needed to complete the race, starting now, starting today.

Though the regenerate soul may falter into sin, by faith he is destined to eternal salvation. Though the unconverted may continually strive after the duties of religion, because of his unbelief he is headed for condemnation. Philpot closes with this admonition: "I have drawn two opposite characters—their beginning, progress and end. Which are you? If an empty professor, unless grace prevent, your sentence is recorded, that you shall lie down in sorrow. If a living soul, though now you are walking in darkness, and have no light, you shall one day behold the face of God with joy."

Descrição: The Hidden Life of Prayer
 was written in 1913. It is a marvelous guide and support to every Christian’s personal prayer. Chapters include Preparation, “Worship,” “Confession,” “Request,” “The Hidden Riches of the Secret Place,” and “The Open Recompense.” In the Introduction, the author sets the stage by describing artwork in one of the great cathedrals: “The third panel introduces us to the inner sanctuary. A solitary worshipper has entered within the veil, and hushed and lowly in the presence of God, bends before the glancing Shekinah. This represents the 
hidden life of prayer 
of which the Master spoke in the familiar words, ‘But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly’ (Mat 6:6). How to pray in this active communion with God is the subject of this excellent piece.

Philpot first addresses the spiritual exercises distinct to the people of God, followed by the special deliverances of God to His people. He then remarks on the special external marks of believers, in which, "They will be separate from the world." In his closing words, he observes "the marks visible to the Church of God", the marks of true and saving salvation in Christ by which these souls are found to be "His Own Special People."

Título: Holiness
Autor: Joel Beeke
Descrição: Holiness
 – 
from the Introduction
: “There is a simple yet profound word which occurs nine hundred times in the Bible. You see it first in Genesis, as we are informed how God created heaven and earth. You see it last in the Bible's final chapter, where we are told about God's creation of a new heaven and a new earth. One entire book, Leviticus, is devoted to the subject of this word. Yet this word is strangely overlooked today. Though it describes the uniqueness of God and the calling of all His children, it is largely ignored. This short yet awesome word is 
holy. 
Among other words, 
saint, sanctify, 
and 
sanctification 
are obtained from its root. What does 
holy, holiness 
mean? What is the scriptural 
call to holiness? 
How must holiness be 
practiced? 
Why does the church so desperately need holiness in our day?” Joel Beeke effectively answers these questions, using the Scriptures as authority and guide.

Título: Holiness and Humility
Autor: Andrew Murray
Descrição: In this tract, Andrew Murray explains how we can determine if the holiness we profess or seek is genuine. He gives his conclusion in the first paragraph. “The one infallible test of our holiness will be the humility before God and men that marks us. Humility is the bloom and the beauty of holiness.” On the other hand, “The chief mark of counterfeit holiness is its lack of humility.” Murray goes on to illustrate the point using the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector. Finally, he warns all who seek or teach holiness that “There is no pride so dangerous, because none is so subtle or insidious, as the pride of holiness.” He ends with this plea, “Come let us flee to Jesus, and hide ourselves in Him until we be clothed upon with His humility. That alone is our holiness.”

and therefore it is peculiarly and pre-eminently “the Lord’s Day,” and so it is expressly denominated in Revelation1:10. It is the day which the Lord made specially for this Christian dispensation, namely, the first of the week. It is the day which has been made forever memorable by loosing the Redeemer from the pains of death. It is now the day in which His people are to celebrate the Saviour’s victory over the sepulchre. And therefore Christians must exclaim, “we will rejoice and be glad in it”: not only because of its appointment, but because of its occasion, for Christ’s resurrection was both for His own honour and for our salvation. Holy mirth, then, should fill our hearts at this season: Sabbath Days ought to be unto us as foretastes of Heaven itself. Then let us welcome each weekly return of it, and duly tune our hearts to show forth His praises therein.

Título: Holy Spirit - Holy Music: Contemporary Christian Music Exposed to Truth
Autor: Richard Taddeucci
Descrição: 1 Timothy 4:1 reads, “Now the Spirit expressly says that in the latter times some will depart from the faith giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons.” We are indeed living in the times that the Spirit describes. The departing from the faith has come as a consequence for not believing the Word of God is the “voice of the Lord your God” (Deu 8:20). Jesus said of these times that “because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold” (Mat 24:12). The coldness is a lack of real love for His Word, lacking any serious desire to obey it and to be conformed by it. Many claim to passionately ‘love the Lord,’ but without a manifest love for what He says. This effort is not to propose that I have the last word on music, but to take it out of the darkness of subjective reasonings and traditions of men, and place it in the light of the Word of God.—

is a classic expository study of the person and work of the Holy Spirit. First, the Spirit is presented as the Third Person of the Trinity: definitely a Person and not a mystical spiritual “force.” As part of who He is, His deity, titles, and covenant-offices are examined. Then, the work of the Holy Spirit is presented in relation to Christ: always to glorify Christ and manifest Him to the believer, in both objective and subjective aspects of His ministry. In 
salvation
: regeneration, quickening, enlightening to truth, convicting of sin, comforting instead of self-comfort, drawing to faith (and in fact granting faith), ending in spiritual peace and joy. Then the very practical aspects of 
sanctification:
 teaching, cleansing from sin (mortification), leading, assuring, interceding, and preserving until Christ returns.

Título: Holy Spirit's Intercession
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: In this sermon on Romans 8:26-27, Spurgeon shows us how the Holy Spirit helps us in our prayers. The Holy Spirit inspires prayer in us from our inmost soul. These prayers are sometimes deeper than can be expressed in words.  "All the prayers which the Spirit of God inspires in us must succeed, because...there is a meaning in them which God reads and approves." These prayers are according to the will of God and will be answered!

Título: Holy Spirit's Work In Salvation, The
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this booklet A. W. Pink examines the following aspects of the Holy Spirit’s work in salvation: regenerating, quickening, enlightening, convicting, comforting, drawing, and working faith. His biblical insights regarding the first (regeneration) and the last (faith) are particularly valuable today because these two areas are frequently misunderstood by modern evangelicals. Regeneration, for example, is believed by many to be the 
result
 of one’s “decision for Christ.” But as Pink shows, regeneration 
precedes
 repentance and belief. Likewise—and also unlike what many believe today—faith is not something that can be produced at will, but is a gift of God given by the Holy Spirit. It is sometimes lamented that the Holy Spirit is the “forgotten” member of the Trinity; but forgotten or not, it is always profitable to study the Spirit’s work, especially His role in salvation as presented in this booklet.

Título: Hour with George Mueller, An

Descrição: An interview with George Mueller of Bristol.
 
“He received me with a cordial handshake and bade me welcome. It is something merely to see a man by whom God has accomplished a mighty work: it is more to hear the tones of his voice; far greater than either is the privilege of being brought into immediate contact with his spirit and of feeling the warm breath of his soul breathed into one’s own. The communion of that hour will be graven on my memory while life shall last. This servant of the Most High opened his heart to me, counseled me, prayed with me, and gave me his blessing. In that hour the source of George Mueller’s great spiritual strength was clearly made manifest. The aged saint with all his faculties unimpaired, was eloquent the whole time on one theme, the praise of Jehovah, the great Hearer and Answerer of His people’s prayers. My own words were few.
 
“You have always found the Lord faithful to His promise, Mr. Mueller?
 
“Always! He has never failed me!...”

Título: How Men Come to Christ
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: In this tract Charles Spurgeon explains the truth Christ declares in John 6:44: no man can come to Christ unless the Father draw him. First, he refutes a common Arminian view that suggests God uses preaching alone to draw men to Christ, leaving the rest up to man. He also repudiates the assertion that Spurgeon, and those like him, teach that God drags men to Christ against their will. But since all men are naturally resistant, how does the Father draw them? According to Spurgeon, He sends the Holy Spirit to change men’s hearts so that they come willingly to the Savior without any compulsion whatever. How is this accomplished? Only God knows, but if the Holy Spirit’s influence is not brought to bear, “there never has been and there never will be any man who either can or will come to the Lord Jesus Christ.”

Título: Human Inability
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: In this booklet, Charles Spurgeon explores the doctrine of natural man’s inability to come to Christ for salvation. Indeed, he states the doctrine in terms that are—in his words—“very startling, some say very obnoxious.” He puts it this way, “Coming to Christ, though described by some people as being the very easiest thing in the world, is in our text (John 6:44) declared to be a thing utterly and entirely impossible to any man, unless the Father shall draw him to Christ.” According to Spurgeon, the primary reason for this is that man 
will not
 come to Christ because he chooses only according to his nature that has, since the fall, “become…debased, depraved, and corrupt.” At the same time, natural man 
cannot
 come to Christ because he is dead in trespasses and sins (Eph 2:1). Spurgeon goes on to describe how the Father draws men, and finally the “sweet consolation” that results.

Descrição: In this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster, we learn of the great sin of hypocrisy. Andrew Bromhall shows us the danger of this sin. The hypocrite's two-faced character is declared by Charles H. Spurgeon. Thomas Brooks reminds us that no hypocrite makes God or Christ his ultimate reason for existence. Jonathan Edwards describes a hypocrite as a prayerless man. How far may hypocrites go? This compelling question is answered by David Clarkson, who shows that some can seem to be so close, yet be so very far away from heaven. Jonathan Edwards brings a stirring reminder that fear will overtake the hypocrite at the last Day. As Thomas Boston shows, a true Christian can be discerned by his heart religion. Lastly, Charles Spurgeon applies these truths, as he considers, "What if I find hypocrisy in me?"

Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: “It is one of the excellencies of the Creator which distinguishes Him from all His creatures.” So begins A. W. Pink in this tract on God’s immutability (the Biblical truth that God does not change). He goes on to describe how God is unchangeable in His essence, His attributes, and His counsel (that is, His will). In conclusion, Pink brings the discussion down to the practical level by pointing out that the doctrine of immutability has a dark side as well as a light side—equally insuring performance of God’s promises and execution of His wrath. The result is solid comfort for believers and terror for the wicked.

Título: Imputed Righteousness
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: Our righteousness is not in ourselves but in our substitute, Christ Jesus, Who gave Himself for us. In this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster, Charles Spurgeon first defines imputed righteousness. Horatius Bonar provides a biblical examination and description of God's way of reckoning righteousness to those who believe. In the third article, John Calvin explains that we must look outside ourselves for the righteousness that God accepts. Charles Hodge gives a detailed study of the imputation of Christ's righteousness, defining the terms, proving the doctrine and examining apostolic arguments. Ebenezer Erksine follows with a brief overview of Adam's fall in the Garden and Christ's deliverance by obtaining righteousness for His people. In his second article, Bonar considers some objections to the doctrine of Christ's substitutionary work and imputed righteousness. Thomas Brooks gives us reasons for comfort, joy, and exuberant worship flowing from the imputation of Christ's righteousness to believers. Lastly, J. C. Ryle gives us some penetrating questions and answers for all to consider in the light of Christ's return.

Título: Incarnation
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: To help us all think better about this “most extraordinary and amazing affair,” we present this issue of the FGB, 
Incarnation
. To introduce the subject, J. C. Ryle gives a helpful, clear, and biblical explanation of the fundamentals of Christ’s incarnation. John Flavel then gives us an extraordinary glimpse of Christ’s pre-incarnate glory—the glory and relationship of love that He had with His heavenly Father before the world began. Far too many Christians in our day think only of the Incarnation in terms of the babe in the manger, without relating it to God’s eternal purpose—His counsels and decrees; A. W. Pink helps us to overcome that shortsightedness. While we are on the subject of the pre-incarnate Christ, Lorraine Boettner gives us a useful survey of certain passages that point to Christ’s existence before time: Jesus made abundantly clear that His existence did not simply begin when He was born in Bethlehem. And Bethlehem—“little among the thousands of Judah”—was the very spot on which God’s eternal purpose of redemption became an historical reality. Horatius Bonar tells us, “At Bethlehem, our world’s history begins”—do we believe that? Thomas Boston helps us to understand the birth of Christ—the virgin conception, the sanctification of Christ’s human nature, the union of manhood and Godhead in the person of Christ, and 
why 
Jesus had to be born of a virgin. The glorious doctrine of the Incarnation then unfolds with William S. Plumer, as he describes the greatest event that ever happened—God became man. With a second article, John Flavel explains the necessary humiliation of God’s eternal Son—its nature, degrees, and duration—showing us that Christ had to be greatly humbled before He was highly exalted. Charles Spurgeon gives us the last word: He explains that in the God-man, we may see all the attributes of God. But he would have us focus on 
this
 glorious display: Jesus was full of grace and truth!
 
...From the moment that God announced the woman’s seed that would crush the serpent’s head, history has moved unwaveringly toward one target: the day God would become man. And the God-man entered the world to do what God cannot do—and that is to 
die
. God’s incarnate Son died upon Golgotha to save His people from their sins. No incarnation, no 
humanity
; no incarnation, no 
substitution
; no incarnation, no 
crucifixion
; no incarnation, no 
resurrection
; no incarnation, no 
redemption
—let us then shout for all eternity, “Praise God for the Lord Jesus Christ!”

Autor: Horatius Bonar
Descrição: Horatius Bonar elaborates on the inescapable logic of Romans 8:32—“He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?” He breaks it down into two parts: the one gift and the many gifts. The one gift is “the unspeakable gift” where God spared not his Son so he could spare us. While the gift is one, it is infinite, the gift of all gifts. Furthermore, this one gift was given not for righteous men, but for sinners whose portion was condemnation. So the question comes—if God Is willing to give the ultimate gift to such as us, will He deny us any other needful thing? Clearly, the answer is no. He will “freely give us all things,”—that is, the many gifts.

In these conversations we learn that atonement for sins is not based on anything we do, it is only because of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. Jesus pays the debt and God forgives the sins of those who believe. In a simple description of this astonishing exchange, Bonar brings it down to a personal level when he declares the good news that God is willing to put Christ in 
my place
—that is, Christ “instead of me.” There is no better news than this.

"O brethren, let us unite with one heart and with one soul to plead with God for this neighborhood! Let us carry "London" written on our breasts just as the high priest of old carried the names of the tribes. Mothers, bear your children before God! Fathers, carry your sons and your daughters! Men and brethren, let us take a wicked world and the dark places thereof which are full of the habitations of cruelty! Let us cry aloud and keep no silence, and give to the Lord no rest till he establish and make his Church a praise in the earth."

Descrição: This 
Introductory Essay
 was written for the modern reprinting of John Owen’s 
The Death of Death in the Death of Christ 
(available from The Banner of Truth Trust)
, 
which first appeared in 1684
.
 But the essay is much more; it is a direct refutation of what has become a watered-down man-centered gospel, and a step in the recovery of the God-centered Gospel contained in the Scriptures. There is no doubt that Evangelicalism today is in a state of perplexity and unsettlement. In such matters as the practice of evangelism, the teaching of holiness, the building up of local church life, the pastor’s dealing with souls and the exercise of discipline, there is evidence of widespread dissatisfaction with things as they are and of equally widespread uncertainty as to the road ahead. Without realizing it, we have during the past century bartered that Gospel for a substitute product which, though it looks similar enough in points of detail, is as a whole a decidedly different thing. The essay will help us in one of the most urgent tasks facing Evangelical Christendom today: 
the recovery of the Gospel

Descrição: Over 53 million unborn children have been killed in legal abortions committed in the United States and Canada. We certainly should have a strong ethical basis to legally sanction the ending of so many lives in our nations, plus over a million more each year. We therefore examine the arguments used by those who promote abortion to determine on how strong of a foundation this practice is based. Then we turn to a higher court of authority than human reasoning to set forth the truths of God’s Word that are involved in the issue of abortion.

Descrição: In this short tract, A. W. Pink points out a common problem that plagues the modern church. “Many seem to think that on the cross the Lord Jesus accomplished a work which rendered it unnecessary for the beneficiaries of it to live holy lives on earth.” When Christ cried out “It is finished,” He “had now performed all that was necessary for the Holy Spirit to come and work in the hearts of His people; convincing them of their rebellion, slaying their enmity against God, and producing in them a loving and obedient heart.” Pink ends with a stern warning to those who claim to be believers but live worldly lives—Christ’s finished work avails you nothing if your heart has never been broken by an agonizing realization of your sinfulness, if you still love the world, and if you have not been saved from the power of sin.

Título: Jesus Christ Our Righteousness
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: In this booklet, Charles Spurgeon explains that our salvation as believers consists of two parts. The first is that Christ, as our penal substitute, obtained for us forgiveness of sins by His sacrifice on the cross. The second, and less commonly understood, is that we receive the righteousness of Christ based on His perfect obedience to the law. Spurgeon describes it this way, “We therefore assert, believing that Scripture fully warrants us, that the life of Christ constitutes the righteousness in which His people are to be clothed. His death washed away their sins, His life covered them from head to foot; His death was the sacrifice to God, His life was the gift to man, by which man satisfies the demands of the law.”

Título: Jesus, the Substitute for His People
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: No one wants to be condemned. So begins Charles Spurgeon as he opens up Romans 8:34, laying out the reasons why the believer 
cannot
 be condemned. “Let me help you,” says Spurgeon, “by refreshing your memory with those precious truths concerning Christ, which show that believers are clear before the Lord.” These are fourfold: Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ is seated at the right hand of God, and Christ makes intercession for us. After discussing each of these in detail, he ends with an encouragement for believers, “Go away, ye that love Christ…with the savour of this sweet doctrine on your hearts.” And a warning for unbelievers, “Oh, you who have not trusted Christ, there is present condemnation for you.” Uttering a final plea for unbelievers to trust the crucified Lord, Spurgeon describes the happy outcome, “And with us you shall rejoice that none can condemn you.”

Spurgeon adopts the figure of John Ploughman, a common laborer, to write his insights in the first person about patience, gossip, flattery, business relationships, carefulness and discernment, finances, hypocrisy, hard work, and much more. His humor and expression make the immense worth of this practical wisdom enjoyable and unforgettable.

When under conviction of sin, Spurgeon long agonized over the question: “How God could be just and yet justify me who had been so guilty.” He explains in detail the answer he came to by faith; it is in essence: “He who is the Son of God became man and, in His own blessed Person, bore my sin in His own body on the tree.” He goes on to show what it is to trust Jesus for salvation and concludes with the comforting words,“If you will have the Lord Jesus, He has you already. If you believe on Him, I tell you, you cannot go to hell, for that were to (would) make the perfect sacrifice of Christ to none effect.”

Título: Justification by Faith Alone
Autor: Martin Luther
Descrição: Justification by Faith Alone
 is Martin Luther’s commentary on the essential truth of how we are declared right with God from Galatians 2:16. This truth was the catalyst for the Reformation, which restored biblical Christianity to Western civilization. By nature we are prone to run to the error of law-keeping in order to earn God’s favor—that is, to seek salvation by doing good works. Luther explains how false teachers deceive many with this error, and clearly proclaims the beauty of how Jesus Christ achieved a perfect righteousness for His people at the cross. Luther champions the true role of God’s free grace in justification by faith alone.

Descrição: Justification, the Law, and the Righteousness of Christ
 introduces one of the most important subjects in the Christian faith: justification. Without this work of God no human being alive could have any hope of being right with God because our sins are so evil—in opposition to the righteous demands of God’s holy Law. Justification is God declaring a believing sinner righteous before Him because of the merit of His Son Jesus. Justification goes beyond merely removing the sinner’s guilt; it clothes him with the very righteousness of Jesus Christ, God’s Son.

Título: Killing Effects of Hyper-Calvinism
Autor: Bob Ross
Descrição: Calvinism kills! Well, according to Bob Ross, Calvinistic doctrine rightly kills many things that should be killed: a degraded view of God, false reasons for evangelism, perverting the Scriptures, the flesh. Good riddance--and may these all rest in peace! But, on the other hand, a misuse and abuse of Calvinism (the doctrines of grace) can kill as well. In the hands of the unskilled and immature it can kill things that should stay alive and well! Hyper-Calvinism (Calvinism out of balance) can kill gospel preaching, prayer, a grateful spirit, daily watchfulness, forbearance to the weak, and responsibility to the truth. These vital aspects of Christian living should be living and thriving. We should check our doctrine by Scripture to be sure we have the biblical balance if our approach to God's precious grace is killing off any of these.

Título: Kingdom of God Hidden and Revealed, The
Autor: Joseph Charles Philpot
Descrição: A sermon on Matthew 11:25 - 
 
“At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, 
 O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou 
 hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, 
 and hast revealed them unto babes.”
 
Philpot demonstrates that there are only two kinds of people in the world: those who understand or 'see' God's kingdom and those who don't. By nature we are all enveloped in the dark blindness of sin, but God in His sovereign grace reaches down and gives light to those He will.  
 
He goes on to disclose what kind of people they are whose eyes God opens and who they are He seals in their blindness.
 
Finally, he examines what it is that God hides and makes known. The following section headings grace this portion: Godly Fear, Acquaintance with the Law, Operations of Faith, Exercise of Hope, Spiritual Affection and Divine Love, and the Power of Truth.

Título: Knowing God
Autor: James Innell Packer
Descrição: About 
Knowing God:
  One may consider the difference between eternity in hell or heaven as the difference between knowing 
about
 God and 
knowing
 God. One may possess a great deal of theological knowledge as well as common sense about spiritual matters without ever tasting the realities of knowing God. The author’s design in this work is to bring our unclear thinking into sharp focus. To know God ultimately means to know and love God’s infallible revelation, the Bible; for unless we embrace God’s true character as He has unveiled Himself in Scripture and in Christ, we cannot say that we truly know Him. The author observes, “What makes life worth while is having a big enough objective, something which catches our imagination and lays hold of our allegiance; and this the Christian has, in a way that no other man has. For what higher, more exalted, more compelling goal can there be than to know God?”

Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: For the last 20 years of his life, Edward Payson (1783-1827) was the much beloved pastor of Second Church in Portland, Maine. This collection of what he saw, thought, and felt during the last month of his life—as he experienced the most severe physical suffering—are those of a humble saint at the very gates of Heaven. In a letter to his sister he wrote, “The celestial city is full in my view. Its glories beam upon me, its breezes fan me, its odors are wafted to me, its sounds strike upon my ears, and its spirit is breathed into my heart. Nothing separates me from it but the river of death, which now appears but as an insignificant rill that may be crossed at a single step, whenever God shall give permission.” Always the pastor, Payson directed that at his funeral a label be attached to his breast on which was written, “
Remember the words which I spake unto you while I was yet present with you.” 
And thus even though dead, he still spoke.

Título: Law and Grace
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: In this sermon, Charles Spurgeon explains that the law was never intended to save men. He explores the contrast between law and grace under three headings: the entrance of the law into the world, its entrance into the heart, and the extent that grace excels sin. According to Romans 5:20, God sent the law that “offence might abound.” But how does this happen? In the world, the law sheds additional light on sin, removing all excuses. In the heart, it reveals the total depravity of our nature and our sentence of condemnation—leaving no room for doubt that we are powerless to save ourselves. Finally, Spurgeon demonstrates that grace greatly excels sin in both measure and efficacy. Just as we read in the second part of Romans 5:20, “but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.”

 is a bold exposition of the key New Testament Scriptures which speak of God’s Law. Pink himself describes the scope and importance of this study. “We are assured that the present wide-spread contempt for human law is the inevitable outgrowth of disrespect for divine Law...Christian teachers have vied with each other in denouncing the Law as a ‘yoke of bondage,’ ‘a grievous burden,’ ‘a remorseless enemy’…They have denounced as ‘Legalists’ Christians of the past, who, like Paul, ‘served the Law.’ They have affirmed that grace rules the Law out of the Christian’s life as absolutely as it did out of his salvation…And because many of our Christian leaders have publicly repudiated divine Law, God has visited us with a wave of lawlessness in our churches, homes, and social life...But we have a hope that some who have been under the influence of…antinomianism will have sufficient spiritual discernment to recognize the truth when it is presented to their notice; and it is for them we now write.”

Título: Letters of Samuel Rutherford
Autor: Samuel Rutherford
Descrição: Like John Bunyan in the Bedford jail, Samuel Rutherford did his best work while suffering imprisonment for the Gospel. His opponents had meant to silence him, but instead they perpetuated his ministry through the centuries: it was out of this period that most of his famous Letters came. Addressed to high and low, they were so prized by the recipients that the first collection by Robert McWard appeared in 1664, just three years after Rutherford’s death. The successive editions contained more letters until they grew to the 365 in Andrew Bonar’s classic edition.
 
From this, “the most remarkable series of devotional letters that the literature of the Reformed churches can show,” the great leaders in the church as well as the humblest Christians have drawn strength. It is said of Robert Murray McCheyne that “the 
Letters of Samuel Rutherford
 were often in his hand.” Richard Baxter’s view was that, apart from the Bible, “such a book as Mr. Rutherford’s 
Letters
 the world never saw the like,” while to C.H. Spurgeon they were “the nearest think to inspiration which can be found in all the writings of mere men.” This abridged edition contains thirty of these letters.
 
“You have heard of my trouble, I suppose. It hath pleased our sweet Lord Jesus to let loose the malice of these interdicted lords in his house to deprive me of my ministry at Anwoth, and to confine me, eight score miles from thence, to Aberdeen; and also (which was not done to any before) to inhibit me to speak at all in Jesus’ name within this kingdom, under the pain of rebellion. The cause that ripened their hatred was my book, whereof they accused me on those three days I appeared before them. But let our crowned King in Zion reign! By his grace the loss is theirs, the advantage is Christ’s and truth’s.”—
Samuel Rutherford in a letter to Robert Cunningham, 1636.

Título: Life of Calvin, The
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: This booklet gives a short introductory look at the life of John Calvin. Originally published in Charles Spurgeon’s magazine, 
The Sword and Trowel
, it is well-written and perfect for those who would like a brief overview of Calvin’s life that nevertheless hits all the important high points. Calvin arrived in Paris in 1521 at the age of twelve to study for the priesthood. He struggled when confronted with the true gospel, was eventually converted, and ultimately forced to flee his native country because of Catholic persecution. In due course, he settled in Geneva where he pursued a many-faceted ministry through periods of both opposition (including banishment) and support from the local authorities. All the while, he labored over his most famous theological work, the 
Institutes of the Christian Religion
, revising it several times. Calvin died in 1564, leaving a remarkable legacy as “evangelist, pastor, reformer, theologian, and The Prince of Expositors.”

Descrição: Life of Martin Luther
 by Diana Kleyn and Joel Beeke is a concise summary of Luther’s significant life and contribution to evangelical Christianity. His conscientious search for the truth of salvation through diligent study of the Bible led to the recovery of the biblical doctrine of justification by faith alone. His advocacy for reform in the Roman Catholic Church led to the Protestant Reformation, which spread throughout Germany, France, The Netherlands, Scotland, Sweden, and England, and became a major influence upon which Western culture is formed. Every Christian should be familiar with his life, and give thanks to God for raising him up for such an important time as the Reformation.

Descrição: According to the author of this tract, “the children of God generally do not fall into great and well-known sins,” but there are sins that they commit often which are “like little foxes which spoil the vine (of our lives)—and we become fruitless.” He lists eight of them; two are below.
 
 
Not praying for others. While we often pray for ourselves, our family, and our church, we neglect to pray for the Lord’s servants, missionaries, and all who are in authority.
 
Respect of persons or pleasing man rather than God. This sin is all too common in the churches today and takes many forms—for example, catering to the rich and educated members rather than the poor and uneducated.
 
 
The author ends by urging us to “kill these little foxes that you may not be fruitless.”

Título: London Baptist Confession of Faith - 1689
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: The London Baptist Confession of 1677/89
 played an important role in Baptist history. The Act of Uniformity of 1662 made the new Anglican Prayer Book mandatory for use in all Anglican, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Baptist churches in England. Moreover, the Anglican church abandoned the Westminster Confession and returned to the Thirty-Nine Articles as its official confession of faith. Consequently, with the restoration of the Monarchy, the English Baptists suffered persecution for their faith. In 1677, a group of Particular Baptists met for the purpose of producing a more expansive confession than the previous Baptist confession of 1644. They modeled the Second London Confession on the Westminster Confession, but with significant theological differences regarding church government and baptism. Persecution kept the 1677 document from being officially endorsed by Particular Baptists until 1689, when the Toleration Act was passed. This act enabled religious freedom to co-exist alongside the established churches in England and Scotland. As a result, representatives from over 100 Particular Baptist churches met in London from July 3-11 to discuss and endorse the 1677 document. Though the confession was published in 1677, the General Assembly of Particular Baptist Churches adopted it in 1689; hence it is commonly known as “the 1689.” The Westminster Confession, the Savoy Declaration, and the London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 are considered the most important Reformed confessions arising from the English-speaking world.
 
"This little volume is not issued as an authoritative rule, or code of faith, whereby you are to be fettered, but as an assistance to you in controversy, a confirmation in faith, and a means of edification in righteousness. Here the younger members of our church will have a body of divinity in small compass, and by means of the Scriptural proofs, will be ready to give a reason for the hope that is in them. Be not ashamed of your faith; remember it is the ancient gospel of martyrs, confessors, reformers, and saints. Above all, it is the truth of God, against which the gates of Hell cannot prevail. Let your lives adorn your faith; let your example adorn your creed. Above all live in Christ Jesus, and walk in Him, giving credence to no teaching but that which is manifestly approved of Him and owned by the Holy Spirit. Cleave fast to the Word of God which is here mapped out for you.” 
—Charles Haddon Spurgeon to his own congregation in 1865

Descrição: This life is short and passing quickly, but at the same it is a "long time"  when we consider it as the time of God's mercy and grace in calling us to repentance from sin and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. This tract is a call to every sinner to make diligent use of the time God has graciously given--time to acquaint oneself with God and to prepare for the yet longer time, eternity!

Autor: William Reid
Descrição: Look to Jesus
 leads the student to the Savior of sinners, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Man and Son of God.  Are you a sinner? You will find no security in a religion focused on yourself and your good deeds. Take personal responsibility for your sin, and come to God through Jesus the Savior for pardon and blessing. Jesus died as the substitute for His sinful people, and God is satisfied with the price His Son paid. Having risen triumphantly from the grave and being seated as the King at the Father’s right hand, He now calls you to turn from your sins and your own efforts to save yourself and to rely entirely on Him as your Savior, your Lord, your Life!

Título: Looking unto Jesus
Autor: Theodore Monod
Descrição: Theodore Monod presents this little devotional in two parts—what we should look for when looking to Jesus and what we should not look for. In the first part, he encourages us to look to Jesus as we see Him in the Scriptures, crucified, risen and glorified, giving repentance and forgiveness of sins, preparing a place for us in heaven, and soon returning. The second part includes the admonition to look only to Jesus and not to ourselves, the world, Satan, our troubles, sins, holiness, position in the church, or any other distraction. Monod ends with these uplifting words, "Looking unto Jesus always: thus awaiting the hour when He will call us to pass from earth to Heaven, and from time to eternity—the promised hour, the blessed hour, when at last 'we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is' (1 John 3:2)."

Descrição: The gospel message preached today often omits the simple fact that salvation is of "the Lord." Sinners not only need a "personal Savior"; they must lay down the arms of their rebellion and submit to Him as Lord. In this tract, A W Pink calls us to reconsider a shallow view of the gospel and to keep the order right: Christ is our 
Lord

Título: Lord's Day, The
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: For those who have a new heart, the Lord's Day truly is “a market-day of the soul.” With this in mind, this third Free Grace Broadcaster of 2015 is entitled 
The Lord’s Day. 
That great day is—at least it should be—a taste of glory divine and of the eternal rest that awaits all of God’s elect. What a blessing it is that God has ordered things so that once a week, after every six days of work, we have a day given to Him—one seventh of our time gloriously spent with the One Who loved us and gave Himself for us!
 
This issue begins with Arthur W. Pink, who gives us a glimpse of the origin of the six-days-of-work and one-day-of-rest pattern that God established in His almighty work of creation. J. C. Ryle offers a multitude of Scriptures from the Old and New Testaments that lay the groundwork for the seventh-day Sabbath and the first-day-of-the-week Lord’s Day. Thomas Boston gives a brief exposition of the Fourth Commandment, while Benjamin B. Warfield lays a biblical foundation for observing the Lord’s Day. Why do Christians worship on Sunday instead of Saturday? Archibald A. Hodge helps us to understand the biblical and historical shift from Sabbath to Lord’s Day. Ezekiel Hopkins then gives us a brief glimpse of how we worship on the Lord’s Day in 
public
, while William S. Plumer teaches us that our Lord’s Day responsibilities reach into the 
home
. Apart from worship in public and at home, what kind of works should we do on the Lord’s Day? Ezekiel Hopkins explains works of piety, necessity, and charity. Thomas Case wisely counsels us in honoring the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit on the day of worship. And, finally, Jonathan Edwards makes clear that the Lord’s Day was not given to us to be a burden, but a time of most precious enjoyment—truly a market-day of the soul.
 
Our earnest prayer is that the Lord Jesus, Who died upon Calvary’s cross and rose again the third day, will fill all His children’s hearts with an earnest, honest, and Spirit-wrought love for His Day. Parents and grandparents, we urge you to meditate upon this and teach it to your children and grandchildren. Pastors and teachers, we urge you to preach on this much-neglected subject. And Christians everywhere, we urge you to love the Lord’s Day.

Descrição: The Lord’s Supper
 is a masterful devotional commentary on the holy ordinance instituted by Jesus Christ the night before His passion. The symbolism given in the Upper Room serves as a memorial for Christians throughout the church age. The author wonderfully exalts the glories of the gospel as proclaimed in this ordinance. The last section explores a thorough self-examination so that this means of grace is fully appropriated and applied. Every Christian will be greatly encouraged in the full meaning of their gospel privilege to join the Lord regularly and meaningfully at His Supper.

 commends this biblical ordinance to the full view of Christians today, so that we may fully enter into communion with the Lord Jesus Christ. The Supper was instituted that we may more truly remember the Lord’s death until He comes. When we do, we are strengthened and refreshed in our souls with more clear views of the wonders of Christ’s atonement and mediation. We are brought low, He is exalted, our hearts are cheered, and we more desire to be holy. The author concludes by examining why so many do not come to the Lord’s Table, and showing that all excuses are invalid for the true believer.

Descrição: Jesus said that He had come to seek and to save that which was lost. What does it mean to be lost? Pink shows that this term refers to all the tragic results of the fall. Christ has come seeking those who did not seek for Him, and His mission will be successful! Pink illustrates this in the lives of Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and Saul of Tarsus. God takes great joy in rescuing His lost sheep. "Oh, what holy satisfaction is His each time He sees of the travail of His soul! How His heart is gladdened whenever He secures another of those who were given to Him by the Father!"

Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: A. W. Pink declares that while “The Lord is good to all: and His tender mercies are over all His works” (Ps 145:9), His love is reserved for His elect; moreover, His love is unchangeable, like Himself. But most importantly, the love of God for His people is “in Christ Jesus” (Rom 8:39)—that is, in His person, His blood, His death, and His righteousness. Pink goes on to expand  how God’s love is expressed in the lives of those He has loved from all eternity: first in election, second in redemption, third in effectual calling, and fourth in healing their backsliding. He ends with this plea, “Make God’s wondrous love to you the incentive of your obedience to Him—gratitude requires nothing less.”

Título: Love of God, The
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: According to A.W. Pink, Scripture tells us three things about God’s nature—God is spirit, God is light, and God is love. In this tract, he concentrates on God’s love, pointing out that “It is not simply that God loves, but that He is Love itself.” It is His very nature. Why should we study God’s love? According to Pink, “The better we are acquainted with His love the more will our hearts be drawn out in love to Him.” He goes on to list seven Biblical truths about God’s love. It is not influenced by anything outside of Himself. It is eternal, sovereign, infinite, and immutable. It is holy—not regulated by passion or sentiment, but by principle. And finally, it is gracious; that is undeserved, but given nonetheless. Pink ends with words of encouragement, “How blessed to know that when the world hates us, God loves us.”

Spurgeon addresses this problem of a decline of love in Christ's church with the remedy of remembering, repenting, and returning to Christ.

When his health failed in an attempt to be a missionary in India, he came back to America to stir others for the cause of missions. He never returned to India, but that did not keep him from being an instrument in God's hand to promote the cause of world evangelization. He helped organize the General Convention of the Baptist Denomination in the United States for Foreign Missions. He founded Columbia College in Washington DC. Above all, Luther Rice was a godly man who sensed the reality of his own sin and the grace of God manifested to sinners. He was a man of conviction and prayer, full of power and devotion.

Sin separates from God, and men must turn their from sin and rebellion against Him, believing in Christ who came to save sinners.

 gives detailed explanation of Romans 1:16-32 to show the depth of man’s sin and the downward spiral in which he finds himself, ending in eternal separation from God. The last chapters focus on the living hope we have in Christ, the perfect unmerited Substitute provided by God in His love for us. We see that God’s righteous justice require penalty for sin, that man is incapable of paying for it himself apart from his own death, that a perfect Substitute was provided in Christ at the cross, that man must have holiness in order to stand before God, and that this holiness is found only in Christ.

Descrição: In this booklet, Walter Chantry explains the Biblical view of man’s will. He notes at the very beginning that, “A proper understanding of the content of the gospel and the use of God-honoring methods in evangelism are dependent on one’s grasp of this issue.” Using Matthew 12:33-37, in easy-to-understand terms Chantry carefully lays out the case under four headings: 1) man’s will has a certain freedom, 2) man’s will is not sovereign, 3) man’s will is in bondage to sin, and 4) man’s will is not his hope. He ends by pointing to man’s only real hope. “While we address the wills of men in gospel preaching, they are wills bound in the grave clothes of an evil heart. But as we speak, and the Lord owns His word, sinners are quickened to life by divine power.”

Descrição: What is true repentance and faith like? Jonathan Dickinson answers this question with penetrating care. He reminds us that there is a form of repentance and faith that falls far short of salvation. Evangelical repentance shows itself in mourning over sin, love for God and His Law, and trust in His mercy. It is a daily exercise and results in a total change of life. Saving faith includes a sensible impression of gospel truth, an embrace of the terms of the gospel, a humble trust in Christ alone, submission to His Lordship, love to God and men, and real heart humility.

The Bride’s willing preparation, her separation unto holiness, and her white robes of righteousness unfold before us in splendor. The marriage of the Lamb is so gracious, so lovely and inviting, His people must love Him and follow Him with all their hearts as they look forward to that day.

Descrição: This is a sermon delivered on Sunday December 11th, 1859, by C. H. Spurgeon, at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens, upon the last occasion of his preaching there, when he was only 25 years old. He bases his sermon on the text in Acts 20;26-27—"Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God." A faithful preacher must, like Paul, give his people the entire gospel of Jesus Christ. Spurgeon shows how important this is. Otherwise, the spirits of Christians will become marred and maimed.

Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Here is a challenge to those involved in ministry to maintain personal faithfulness to the Lord. While seeking to be a blessing to others the servant of Christ must attend to the reality of his own walk with Christ and the uprightness of his own character.  It is an echo of  Paul’s concern that when he had preached to others, he himself should not be disqualified. 
 
“The solemn work with which the Christian ministry concerns itself demands a man’s all, and that all at its best. To engage in it half-heartedly is an insult to God and man. Slumber must forsake our eyelids sooner than men shall be allowed to perish. Yet we, are all prone to sleep as do others...therefore have I sought to speak out my whole soul, in the hope that I might not create or foster dullness in others. May He in whose hand are the churches and their pastors bless these words...and if so I shall count it more than a full reward, and shall gratefully praise the Lord.”

Título: Mortification
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: Do we understand what it means to "mortify our members which are upon the earth" (Col 3:5)? A. W. Pink states, "No progress can be made by you in the Christian life, until you realize the paramount importance and imperative necessity of waging a ceaseless warfare against indwelling sin." John Owen tells us, "The choicest believers, who are assuredly freed from the condemning power of sin, ought yet to make it their business all their days to mortify the indwelling power of sin." This is clear from Paul's statement in Romans: "For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (Rom 8:13). 
 
So, what 
is 
mortification, and why is it important? What place does it have in our walk with Christ? These are some of the questions dealt with in this issue of the 
Free Grace Broadcaster.
 
Our opening article by Arthur Pink introduces us to the doctrine of mortification. John Flavel follows by explaining what mortification is not and what it is. Benjamin Needler then teaches us how to search out and identify beloved lusts. Only Christians can truly mortify sin: this is the point of Horatius Bonar's article. John Owen, who wrote a penetrating, helpful book on this subject, gives us clear directions on how to mortify sin. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones shows us that we cannot accomplish this without the power of the Holy Spirit. Many great perils attend our neglect of mortification; Ezekiel Hopkins, who also wrote an important work on this, warns us of them. Ralph Erskine helps us discern the difference between legal and gospel mortification. Finally, Christopher Love explains how we may determine if we are in a state of mortification or not. May this issue of the Broadcaster encourage and help us all in this holy war against sin, which we will fight until we see Christ in all His glory!

Título: Motherhood
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In the early 1600s, a young English woman, Elizabeth Brooke Joscelin, wrote an important letter. She was pregnant and concerned that she might not live to bring up her child. She began her touching letter by addressing her husband: “To my truly loving and most dearly loved husband, Tourell Joscelin: Mine own dear love, I no sooner conceived a hope that I should be made a mother by thee, but with it entered the consideration of a mother’s duty; and shortly after followed the apprehension of danger that might prevent me from executing that care I so exceedingly desired: I mean in Christian training our child.” Throughout her letter, her burning love for her husband, her child, and her Savior shines brightly. She was
 delighted 
with this thought: “that I should be made a mother by thee.” She 
wanted
 to bear children with her husband. Nevertheless, her heart’s desire was not simply to bear children—even non-Christian women sometimes desire this. Her longing for a child was biblically focused on “that care I so exceedingly desired: I mean in Christian training our child.” She wanted to bear and bring up children for the Lord Jesus Christ. Bearing children in her day carried with it a high mortality rate for mother and child. Elizabeth was deeply concerned that she might die without the privilege of teaching her son or daughter about Christ and how to live for Him. How did she calm her realistic fears? She could have avoided this fear altogether by simply practicing birth control or by seeking an abortion (which was available then, though not as readily). But she found her comfort in God’s Word: “These fears were cured with the remembrance that all things work together for the best to those that love God (Rom 8:28) and a certain assurance that He will give me patience according to my pain.”
 
Strengthened with biblical truth, she then wrote an astonishing letter to her unborn child, filled with instructions, biblical thought, and earnest exhortations for how to start, spend, and end the day to God’s glory. It was her Christian legacy to her unborn baby. She wrote detailed warnings, exhortations, and promises about everything from seeking God while a child, to starting and ending the day in prayer, to pursuing humility and modesty in apparel, to studying theology! She concluded the address to her beloved Tourell, “I hope God will so give me His grace that I shall more skillfully 
act
 than apprehend a mother’s duty… Thus, humbly desiring God to give thee all comfort in this life and happiness in the life to come, I leave thee and thine to His most gracious protection.” On October 12, 1622, she gave birth to Theodora. Nine days later, Elizabeth Joscelin died. She was twenty-seven years old.
 
To read Elizabeth’s letter is to step into a different world of motherhood than our own. Her legacy to her unborn child brims with biblical references; in fact, her very thinking seems to be saturated with Proverbs 31, Titus 2, and biblical womanhood. While she never had the pleasure of bringing up Theodora for Christ, her mother’s heart bares itself with astonishing beauty in her humble, but firm exhortations. Her burning desire to bear this child—fully knowing the risk—and her greater desire to bring up this son or daughter for Christ is the very essence of biblical motherhood.
 
For this reason, the theme of this Free Grace Broadcaster is 
Motherhood
, a complement to last quarter’s 
Fatherhood
. Jabez Burns introduces us to the dignity of motherhood, something often lost to our culture. Thomas Boston briefly explores a mother’s main responsibility—a subject quite foreign to our post-Christian worldview. Peter Marshall develops something of a modern parable to show us our desperate need for a return to biblical motherhood. An almost forgotten Scottish Congregationalist named James Cameron gives us three articles—biblically training children, encouraging mothers, and calling mothers to Christ. John Angell James offers a further lo...

Descrição: What is the Christian response to death? The Bible shows us that we have hope beyond the grave. Death has lost its sting for the believer. This message provides a clear Christian testimony of joy and peace in the face of death. This message was first delivered over the Voice of Truth radio broadcast May 21st, 1967, shortly after the author's conversion when he was associate pastor in his father's church. It was first printed in 2003, shortly after L. R. Shelton, Jr.'s death.

Título: Myth of Free Will
Autor: Walter J. Chantry
Descrição: Walter Chantry points out that most people say they believe in “free will.” He then asks some pointed questions: What does that mean?
  
From what is the will free? What is its power? Chantry goes on to examine three myths regarding man’s will. In the myth of circumstantial freedom, he points out that one has the ability to make a decision, but not the power to carry out its purpose. In the myth of ethical freedom, he shows that the will of man is free from outside force, but not from the bias of human nature. And that bias is against God. Finally, in the myth of spiritual freedom, Chantry states that because man is at enmity with his Creator, his whole being hates God, His truth, and His rule. Conclusion: a new heart must be given him before a man will repent and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Título: Neglecting the Gospel
Autor: Thomas Shaw B. Reade
Descrição: In the introduction to this tract, Thomas Reade asks the same question that the author of Hebrews asked, "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?" (Heb. 2:3).
 
He first points out the obvious: that those who hold infidel principles and who live in a total disregard of religious ordinances, despise the salvation of God. But there are others that, while they do not despise God’s salvation, are simply “neglecters of salvation.”
 
According to Reade, this neglect can take three forms:
 
 
Living in the allowed indulgence of one known sin.
 
Building on any other foundation than Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
 
Preferring an earthly object rather than Jesus Christ.
 
 
Reade warns that any of these should excite alarm and call for strict self-examination.

Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: "It is to one special truth in the list of a believer's privileges that I now desire direct your attention this day. That truth is the doctrine of perseverance—the doctrine that true Christians shall never perish or be cast away. It is a truth which the natural heart has bitterly opposed in every age. It is a truth which for many reasons deserves particular attention at the present time. Above all, it is a truth with which the happiness of all God’s children is most closely connected.
 
"There are four things which I propose to do in considering the subject of perseverance. (1) I will explain what the doctrine of perseverance means; (2) I will show the scriptural grounds on which the doctrine is built; (3) I will point out some reasons why many reject the doctrine; (4) I will mention some reasons why the doctrine is of great practical importance."

Título: New Covenant in Christ, The - NT Survey
Autor: Stanford Murrell
Descrição: The New Covenant in Christ
 captures in concise, readable form the history, events, and people of the New Testament, as they meet the Person of Christ and His teachings in the first century. We enter into the likes of a middle eastern bazaar: a bustling, dusty crossroads with all its drama and intrigue. It is a crossroads in every aspect: between the Messiah and His Church; between Jewish and Greek cultures; between peace and persecution, past and future, tradition and Truth, timidity and triumph (and even supernatural courage); between the wisdom of man as represented in the ruling authorities of the day and the wisdom of God emblazoned through the Holy Spirit upon the unlikely heroes—fishermen and a once-blinded Pharisee.
 
The central figure is the carpenter’s Son, revealed to the world in these pages of Scripture as the King of kings and Lord of lords. Today as then, we can know Him personally as Jesus Christ—our Savior, our Lord, and our God!

Descrição: From 
Night of Weeping 
: “For the family of God…the way is rough, and the desert blast is keen. Who of them can say aught regarding their prospects here, save that tribulation awaiteth them in every place as they pass along? This they must know and prepare for, grasping more firmly at every step the gracious hand that is leading them on to the kingdom…Our desire is to minister to the saints in the consolation and admonition of the Lord. We would seek to bear their burdens, to bind up their wounds, and to dry up at least some out of their many tears.”
 
    From 
Morning of Joy
: “Cut off from a home and a heritage here, yet assured of both hereafter, … [the church] feels as if already seated with Him in heavenly places. Looking forward to the arrival of the King, she anticipates the kingdom. In darkness she anticipates the light; in sorrow she anticipates the joy; in the night she anticipates the morning; in shame she anticipates the glory. Losing sight of the bitterness, she tastes the bridal joy…enjoying sabbath rest amid the tumults of a stormy world.”

Descrição: The biblical remedy for pragmatism; a sermon preached by Charles Spurgeon in the context of the "Downgrade Controversy," the controversy surrounding the liberal views of Scripture creeping into the Baptist union of the time. Spurgeon takes Genesis 24 about Abraham's servant seeking a wife for Isaac, and reminds us that there is no room for compromise when we are on the errand of the King. We must not adulterate our doctrine, our church discipline, our standards of holiness. The true servant of God is responsible for diligence and faithfulness; but he is not responsible for success or non-success. Result are in God's hands.

Título: Obedience
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In our day, modern American religion has such a flimsy, worldly, and perverted view of grace, one is not surprised that many professing believers think they are hearing the unbearable clanking of legalistic chains when some preacher is witless enough—or maybe even has the Christlike love for their souls enough—to tell them that the Word of God commands them obey the Lord Jesus Christ. The truth of the matter is that Jesus Himself says that obeying Him is our expression of love for Him; in fact, He goes on to say that we positively do not love Him if we do not obey Him. This is sobering, but biblical truth.
 
With this is mind, we present the latest Free Grace Broadcaster: 
Obedience
.
 
Pastors—when was the last time you taught Christ's blood-bought people the importance of obedience to Christ? Parents—does your life of obedience to Christ fill your home, your family worship, your daily lives with the fragrance of Christ's grace? How we pray that this issue of the FGB will stir your heart to love Christ Jesus by keeping His commandments! His precious blood, spilled on Calvary's cross, not only cleanses us, but sanctifies as well. May our hearts pour out our love to Christ by fervent, humble, joyful obedience to Him. Obey is a four-letter word that blood-bought believers should love.

Título: Obstacles to Coming to Christ
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this tract, A. W. Pink considers the truth of Jesus’ words in John 6:44 “No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him.” He goes on to point out that the reason this is such a “hard saying,” even to many professing Christians, is that they fail to realize the terrible havoc which the Fall has wrought. According to Pink, the inability of natural man does not spring from any physical or mental defect, but from the utter devastation which the Fall inflicted in four areas—man’s corrupt nature, the complete darkness of his understanding, the complete corruption of his affections (that is, what he loves), and the total perversity of his will. Pink ends with a quote from Charles Spurgeon, “Without the powerful, supernatural, irresistible influence of the Holy Spirit, no human being will ever be constrained toward Christ.”

I hope very many of you know this choice blessing of living in the immediate enjoyment of your Saviour’s love. May you never lose it!"

Descrição: Introducing this tract, James laments that “so few are found who are engaged in this high Christian privilege.” He goes on to elaborate what it means to walk with God. First, one must have been regenerated and possess eternal life. Second, those who walk with God meet much opposition “for they will oppose the course of this world.” Third, they have the seal of adoption as sons and daughters of God the Father, the sovereign Ruler over heaven and earth. Fourth, they love God supremely and “cannot be satisfied without the friendship of God.” James ends with this lively encouragement: “As beggars dressed in the robes of God’s righteousness, we forget the trials of this lower land and soar and sing of Him Who ever loved us and made choice of us.”

Título: Open-Air Preaching
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: An often overlooked ministry in the church today is that of the open-air preacher. What has open-air preaching looked like over the centuries of church history? And what are some basic principles that we should use in practicing this work today? Spurgeon answers both questions in this fascinating study of open-air preaching.
 
Open-Air Preaching 
is adapted from two chapters of 
Lectures to My Students 
entitled “Open-Air Preaching and Its History” and “Open-Air Preaching—Remarks Thereon.” Charles H. Spurgeon delivered his 
Lectures to My Students 
to men preparing for the ministry at his Pastor’s College. He founded the college to provide a place where men called to preach could study at low cost and with a clear focus on preparation for ministry rather than scholastic achievement.

Título: Parents' Groans Over Their Ungodly Children
Autor: Edward Lawrence
Descrição: Parents’ Groans over Their Ungodly Children 
was written by Edward Lawrence (1623-1695) for his own unsaved children. This 17
th
 century Puritan pastor shares the burden of all such parents and encourages them to bear it in the strength of the Lord.
 
The following is from his preface:
 
To All Christian Parents:  “It is not only for the sake of myself and children, but also for the sake of you and yours that I have published this little book; but especially out of respect to the glory of God, that we may leave a seed to bless him in this world, when we are glorifying him in the better world…Give to every one of your children one of these books, and do likewise bestow some of them upon the children of the poor…I am a lover of children and have often lifted up my heart in prayer to God for them…Pray that we may leave that religion, which came originally from the Father of Jesus Christ and is revealed to us in the Scriptures, to our posterity and that they may have hearts to live according to the rules and principles of it more than we have done.”                                                    —
Edward Lawrence, 1681

But before you have such unkind thoughts, pleasehear me out. If we are Christians, our service and worship will be regulated by the Word of God. The Bibleis our infallible guide in faith and worship. Now here is the surprising thing. Nowhere in the Bible, either inthe Old Testament or New Testament, is there a physical description of Christ..."

Título: Postmodernism
Autor: Erroll Hulse
Descrição: As a philosophy, 
Postmodernism 
appears everywhere. Our new teachers, journalists, lawyers, judges, and political leaders have been indoctrinated. Postmodernism reigns in politics and in our institutions of learning. While this philosophy holds sway in establishing the thought patterns prevalent in society today, evangelical Christianity is at the same time either dismissed or marginalized. 
This booklet is an important tool for the Christian church to use to retake high ground in the conflict with modern secular culture. It introduces non-Christians to the uniqueness of the Christian worldview and, for believers, gives effective voice to vital truths. In consecutive sections on deconstructionism, moral relativism, pluralism, and existentialism, the author first defines terms and then shows the superiority of the gospel.

Título: Pray for the Spirit
Autor: James W. Alexander
Descrição: In these last days, it is important to distinguish between true and false revival. In this tract, J. W. Alexander examines aspects of true revival. He first writes, "In order to have mighty revival, what we especially need is for the whole church to be down on its knees before God." This is crucial because it is God's grace through the Holy Spirit that begins and carries on the work. On the other hand, without the Spirit the work of men is futile. It will never produce true revival, for "the Spirit is the Author of regeneration and sanctification" — and both are necessary hallmarks of true revival. Finally, while we pray we must also work, because the "children of the wicked one will not come to the light; it must be carried to them." In the end, Alexander notes, "Every great awakening has proceeded from the Holy Spirit. Therefore pray for the Spirit."

Título: Prayer
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: Based on Mark 11:24 and speaking directly to believers, A. W. Pink points out and elaborates on three things that are necessary for effective prayer. First, make sure that you are asking for something that is in accordance with God’s revealed will, which is found in His Word. Second, having made sure that your prayer is in God's will, plead the promises which are also in His Word. Plead them in the name of Christ that He may be honored and that you may be helped in godly living. Third, expect God to do as you have asked. According to Pink, “If your requests are for God’s glory and your (real) good, be assured that they shall be granted.” Finally, he urges us never to forget that we have a Friend in the Court of Heaven—Jesus Christ our Savior and Advocate.

Título: Prayer from Hell, A
Autor: Holmes Moore
Descrição: Taking our Savior’s story of the rich man and Lazarus, Pastor Moore gives an overview of the rich man’s prayer divided into three parts—and draws lessons for us from each. 
 
First, the circumstances of this prayer serve to instruct us.
 The rich man prayed when he saw the kingdom of God; he prayed earnestly from a sense of need and in great agony, but he prayed too late.
 
Second, the petitions of this prayer are intended for our correction.
 He prayed to the wrong person, asked for the wrong deliverer, and sought the wrong water.
 
Third, the mocking response to this prayer is for our solemn warning. 
Abraham called him “son,” asked him “to remember,” and “to consider what he has missed.” Finally, he is told that hell is forever. And this dreadful fact will mock its inhabitants eternally.

Título: Precious Things
Autor: M. Luther Hux
Descrição: What do you consider precious? Luther Hux presents eight things to which the Bible attaches great value, describing them each as precious. Quoting 2 Peter 1:1, which speaks of those who “have obtained like precious faith,” Hux explains his purpose in writing. “The word 
precious
 is used a number times in the Bible to denote some striking things, and it is my desire here to direct your attention to these interesting objects which are deserving of that name.” Beginning with precious faith, he goes on to examine seven more biblically-precious things: the precious blood, precious Christ, precious trial, precious promises, precious fruit, precious seed, and finally, precious death. Hux ends with this plea, “May the Lord give us all an understanding of these wonderful things…that we may be better servants of His.”

 critiques the modern methods of evangelism. It calls us to the robust God-centered evangelism model of the Scriptures, rather than a man-centered approach. The true Gospel of Jesus Christ is the astonishing news that the Son of God is the suffering Savior from sin and that He is the exalted Lord calling men to turn to Him in repentance and faith. In the Bible, salvation is more than a ticket to heaven; it is deliverance from the effects of sin, and, more importantly, from sin itself!

Título: Present Duty before Approaching Darkness
Autor: Ralph Erskine
Descrição: In the face of this dark fallen world and the certainty of eventual death, how is the Christian to stay continually fixed on the glorification of God? Answering this vital question, Ralph Erskine asserts that rather than trusting in themselves, Christian are to glorify God in a spirit of "faith and humiliation" which relies upon Christ as the source of strength. In this spirit of faith and humiliation, God is glorified by the service of His people to Him; which is a demonstration that it is their "principal honour and happiness to be employed in his service, and so a proclaiming that he is a good and bountiful Master. Men are thereby induced to believe, when we are painful and diligent in his service, that there is a great pleasure in it, and a great reward for it."

Título: Problem of a Suffering Christian, The
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this tract, A. W. Pink describes several heart-wrenching examples of a suffering Christian, a situation that puzzles many. According to Pink, Paul casts light on this perplexing problem in Romans Chapter 8 when he shows that the sufferings of this present time (v. 18) “are not inconsistent with the special favor and infinite love which God bears to His people.” He then gives four ways this is true.
 
 
We are brought into fellowship with the sufferings of Christ;
 
There is a vast disproportion between our present sufferings and future glory;
 
Our very sufferings provide for the development of hope and patience;
 
Divine help is given by the Holy Spirit so that we are able to endure our afflictions.
 
 
Thus, God does not abandon us in our sufferings, but uses them for our good and His glory.

Título: Professing Christians Warned
Autor: Gary Hendrix
Descrição: In light of the current widespread practice of equating salvation with a mere profession of faith, Pastor Gary Hendrix encourages every professor of faith in Christ to “give diligence to make your calling and election sure" (2 Pet 1:10). If this is not done, the result could be catastrophic. “Many who are confident of their relationship to Christ and make this profession with all boldness will spend eternity under the wrath of God.” So what is the evidence of salvation? Pastor Hendrix answers with 1 John 3:1-10. The apostle John’s major contention in this passage is simply this: “The child of God will strive after holiness and will in fact maintain a pattern of righteousness.” Hendrix ends with the penetrating question, “Now I must inquire, how do you view yourself in light of 1 John chapter three?”

Autor: Lee Roy Shelton, Jr.
Descrição: Searching messages preached on true conversion. There has never been a day in the history of the church when seemingly there has been more profession and less practice of godliness than is witnessed in our churches today. Where is the vital godliness and holiness that characterized the church in the Acts of the Apostles? Where is the fruit of the Spirit, the love for souls, and a crucifixion to the world? True conversion results in a changed life, a holy walk, and a love for God.

Título: Profiting from the Word
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: Profiting from the Word 
was originally published as a series of related articles in 
Studies in the Scriptures. 
“All Scripture,” we are told in 2 Timothy 3:16, “is profitable,” but how much do we gain from our reading of Scripture, and by what means can we learn to profit more? These fundamental questions provide the theme for this book. Both readable and immensely practical, it has all the characteristics which have led to Pink’s recognition as one of the finest Christian writers of the twentieth century. It is a help to Christians young and old.

Título: Proverbs
Autor: Charles Bridges
Descrição: Bridges’ 
Proverbs 
is “The best work on the Proverbs. While explaining the passage in hand, he sets other portions of the Word in new lights.”—
C. H. Spurgeon
 
“While other  parts of Scripture show us the glory of our high calling, this book may instruct us in all minuteness of detail how to “walk worthy” of it (Col 1:10). We see the minuteness of out Christian obligations; that there is not a temper, a look, a word, a movement, the most important action of the day, the  smallest relative duty, in which we do not either deface or adorn the image of our Lord, and the profession of His name. Surely if the book conduced to no other end, it tends to humble even the most consistent servant of God, in consciousness of countless failures. The whole book is a mirror for us all, not only to show our defects, but also [as] a guidebook and directory for godly conduct.”—
Charles Bridges, from the Preface, 1846

Descrição: This is an excerpt from Spurgeon's 
Treasury of David
, a classic commentary on the Psalms. Psalm 139 is one of the most notable of the sacred hymns. It sings the omniscience and omnipresence of God, inferring from these the overthrow of the powers of wickedness, since He who sees and hears the abominable deeds and words of the rebellious will surely deal with them according to His justice...It flames out with such flashes of light as to turn night into day...This holy song casts a clear light even to the uttermost parts of the sea, and warns it against the practical atheism which ignores the presence of God, and so makes shipwreck of the soul.

Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: In a day when worship is often considered in terms of how it benefits the worshiper, or how it makes a person feel, Ryle’s  instruction and exhortation come as an essential call to return to God-centered worship. Public worship is for God. We must worship in a way that agrees with God’s Word and observe the parts of worship that Scripture urges us to employ. There are errors to avoid relating to worship. And then there are crucial tests for us to apply to our worship to help us discern whether we are worshiping God rightly.

Descrição: The Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment 
first appeared in 1648, and is now available in a quality, abridged format. An exposition of Philippians 4:11, it describes the inner satisfaction enjoyed by true Christians who look up to Christ as their life, and not down at this world’s many problems. It is happiness without having everything we want. It is joy even when we feel sad. It is true contentment in the will of God, and not just because there is nothing else we can do. Every Christian will benefit from reading, meditating on, and applying this precious book.

(4 volumes), available through Reformation Heritage Books (heritagebooks.org). 
 
"In my opinion, this is one of the most valuable set of books available in English today. I don’t say this because I had the privilege of organizing the task, raising the funds for its translation and printing, and serving as its final editor a quarter of a century ago, but I believe this is true because of the rich doctrinal, experiential, practical, pastoral, and ethical content this classic conveys. When one reads Brakel, one is not surprised to learn that for centuries this set of books was as popular in the Netherlands as John Bunyan’s 
Pilgrim’s Progress
 was in English-speaking countries. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, most Dutch farmers who were of Reformed persuasion would typically read a few pages of “Father Brakel,” as he was fondly called, every evening to his family as an important part of their family worship. When he completed the entire work, he would start over!" -

th
 century England, he had much experience in exercising his faith by trusting God daily, and even hourly, for the resources to keep them running. According to Mueller, our faith must be based on the Word of God and is almost always exercised and developed through trials, losses, and troubles. His advice? “Begin in a little way.” And your faith, based solidly on the promises of God, will increase step by step.

Título: Reality of Hell, The
Autor: Bob Ross
Descrição: This tract presents a short primer on the Biblical doctrine of hell. Bob Ross explains that the words “sheol” and “hades,” both of which are sometimes translated as “hell,” do not explicitly or exclusively refer to hell, but actually mean the place of departed spirits—whether saved or lost. The Greek word “gehenna,” however, clearly does mean hell. Along with other chilling descriptions, Jesus repeatedly used this term to warn of eternal punishment for those who remain unrepentant. Despite some modern day denials, Scripture unequivocally describes hell as a place of physical, unquenchable fire which lasts forever and ever. In the end, Ross pleads for those who are without Christ to submit to Him by faith, “for redemption from sin, death, and hell.”

Título: Regeneration
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: "Regeneration is an intensely solemn thing. The new birth is the dividing line between Heaven and Hell. In God’s sight there are but two classes of people on this earth: those who are dead in sins, and those who are walking in newness of life. In the physical realm there is no such thing as being between life and death. A man is either dead or alive. The vital spark may be very dim, but while it exists, life is present. Let that spark go out altogether, and though you may dress the body in beautiful clothes, nevertheless, it is nothing more than a corpse. So it is in the spiritual realm. We are either saints or sinners, spiritually alive or spiritually dead, children of God or children of the Devil. In view of this solemn fact, how momentous is the question, Have I been born again? If not, and you die in your present state, you will wish you had never been born at all."-From the Introduction. 
 
Here we learn the necessity, nature, and effects of the miracle of the new birth.

Título: Remember Lot's Wife
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: In Luke 
17:32
, Jesus says, 
“Remember Lot’s wife.” According to J. C. Ryle, there are few warnings in Scripture more solemn than this. It is solemn because of the person Jesus names—not a godly person like Abraham, or Hannah, or Ruth, but one whose soul was lost forever. As Lot’s wife, she was part of Abraham’s family and thus enjoyed the greatest exposure to true salvation in her time. But Ryle asks, “Yet what good effect had all these privileges on the heart of Lot’s wife? None at all. She lived and died graceless, godless, impenitent, and unbelieving.” This teaches us that privileges alone are not what men need; they need the grace of the Holy Ghost. Ryle ends by asking a pointed question, “Have you yet received the Holy Ghost? If not, you are no better than Lot’s wife.”

absolutely necessary
 if the sinner is to make peace with God.” He goes on to describe repentance as, “A holy hatred and horror of sin, a deep sorrow for it, and acknowledgement of it before God, and a 
complete heart forsaking of it
.” Pink ends this short tract with a chilling statement and a question, “Turn from your course of self-will; turn with full purpose of heart to please and serve HIM: or be tormented day and night, forever and ever, in the Lake of Fire. Which shall it be?”

Título: Repentance--Legal vs. True
Autor: James Heard
Descrição: According to James Heard, true repentance and true faith are products of regeneration by the Holy Spirit. He notes that there is also a false (or legal) repentance. This repentance arises from a fear of punishment, but is not accompanied by hatred of sin and self. So what does true repentance look like? It is a gift of God wrought in the heart so that a sinner is humbled by godly sorrow and abhors himself and his sin, crying out for forgiveness. It consists of three elements—a change of mind, a change of feeling, and a change of purpose. Heard uses the story of the prodigal son to illustrate these and then quotes Acts 3:19 to show the glorious results of repentance, “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out…”

Título: Resolutions of Jonathan Edwards, The
Autor: Jonathan Edwards
Descrição: Beginning in 1722 at age 19, Jonathan Edwards wrote 70 resolutions designed to help him live a holy life. In a short preface, he humbly entreated God’s grace for help in keeping them. He also reportedly reviewed the resolutions once a week. The first one seems to summarize his overall purpose—“Resolved, that I will do whatsoever I think to be most to God’s glory, and my own good …and most for the good and advantage of mankind in general.” Other resolutions include speaking only the truth, temperance in eating and drinking, constantly studying the Scriptures, and much more. But most remarkable for such a young man were several resolutions which, in considering his own death, he resolved to live in such a way that there would be no regrets on that day. Edwards left us a beautiful 18th century example, one we would do well to emulate today.

Título: Resurrection
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: Some of us seem to have let the resurrection drift to a very distant—perhaps for some, a non-existent—place in our preaching. Where this is so, it is entirely out of harmony with biblical gospel proclamation. I urge you to sit down with your Bible and prayerfully, carefully read through the book of Acts. There we find genuine, Holy Spirit-filled preaching of the good news of Jesus Christ. You will observe there the prominence, sometimes even the primacy, of Christ’s resurrection. A dying Savior purchased our pardon; a living Savior proved the Father’s acceptance of His sacrifice! We must not separate these two glorious works of Christ, these two mighty pillars of the gospel.
 
With this in mind, we offer the latest volume of the 
Free Grace Broadcaster
—
Resurrection
. God’s people need this blessed, encouraging truth impressed upon their hearts. It is indeed food for the believer’s hungry soul. Charles Spurgeon leads the way by showing us the importance of the resurrection as gospel truth. Even in his day, many were straying from or distorting this essential doctrine. J. C. Ryle points out the remarkable contrast between the 
fact
 of the resurrection and the 
slowness
 of Christ’s disciples to believe it! Albert N. Martin then sets before us four truths about Christ’s rising from the dead that magnify its glory and splendor. What is the evidence for our Lord’s resurrection? William S. Plumer examines and details it for us, and then Thomas Manton describes the numerous benefits believers receive from it—what a treasure chest! That mighty preacher from the Great Awakening, George Whitefield, explains the power of the resurrection in the Christian’s soul, and David Martyn Lloyd-Jones demonstrates the crucial connection between Christ’s resurrection and the believer’s daily life. Finally, Charles Spurgeon gets the last word on this glorious subject: he tells us that Christ was the first to rise again and that the believer’s resurrection is guaranteed because of it! Let us praise the name of the Lord!

Through His wrath upon Christ at the cross, God's righteousness was revealed "by a more awful display of his justice, than if the whole human race had been left to perish." The righteous God works "as the Saviour of sinners, providing means by which the most guilty of the sons of men... may be restored." Drawing from the history of this redemption as shown in the Scriptures, Haldane notes several examples of God's righteousness revealed to fallen man. He ends with applications from this subject.

Descrição: Revelation 20 is one of the most controversial passages in the Bible. Here Pastor Shelton presents a helpful commentary which deals with some of the major items in the passage, such as the thousand year millenium, the mark of the beast, and the great white throne judgment. As he states in the Introduction, "A correct understanding of the truths contained in this chapter will cause the child of God to praise his risen Lord for all He has done for Him in giving him SO GREAT SALVATION. Will it not encourage our hearts to know that we, the true Israel of God, the children of God, rule and reign with Christ right now? and to know that when Satan is loosed for a little season, we will have as our hiding place the living God Himself in Jesus Christ our Lord?"

Título: Revival  (three revival sermons)
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: This booklet presents three revival sermons by Charles Spurgeon. In the first, he deals with the church’s preparation for revival and in the second, her pleadings for revival. His third sermon emphasizes, among other things, the wonderful stories of what the Lord has done in the past. He first rehearses some of God’s powerful works of Old Testament days and then moves quickly to the wonders which he says most concern us—those of the Christian era. Highlights include the first Holy Spirit revival on the day of Pentecost, the times of the Church Fathers, the Reformation, and the Great Awakening. Clearly then, God can certainly—and suddenly—bring the revival that we so desperately need in these dark days. Let Spurgeon’s words encourage you, “the wondrous things that God did in the olden times, by His grace He will yet do again.”

And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be,which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”

Título: Righteousness for the Unrighteous
Autor: Claude Duval Cole
Descrição: According to the author, if he had one sermon to preach to the whole world, the message would show how an unrighteous man may become righteous before God. He goes on to describe the universal unrighteousness of men and their obligation to obey all of God’s law, pointing out that without perfect obedience the sinner could only be saved at the expense of justice. If sinners are saved then, it must be through a plan where God remains just and yet justifies the ungodly. And so it was that Christ kept the law perfectly and paid its penalty fully for His people so that they might be declared righteous. The author pleads with his readers, “If you are lost, let me urge you to acknowledge before God and men that you have no righteousness of your own, and trust Christ for the righteousness God has provided in Him.”

Título: Righteousness of God, The
Autor: Horatius Bonar
Descrição: Horatius Bonar examines the righteousness of God and justification by faith. On the very first page he describes mankind’s problem: “The Law cannot give a righteousness; it is merely a declaration of what righteousness is. It condemns; it cannot justify.” He goes on to declare that there is a righteousness “which meets the case of the unrighteous in every part.” How can we characterize this righteousness? Among other things, it is the righteousness of God, a righteousness without the law, a righteousness to which the Scriptures bear witness, and a righteousness perfectly suited to the unrighteous. Bonar then turns to justification by faith, pointing out that it is God who justifies the ungodly with a righteous, complete, irreversible, and divine justification. Finally, he warns that those who perish because they reject the offer of God’s righteousness have no one but themselves to blame.

Descrição: In this booklet, Ebenezer Erskine explains how sin has alienated men from God and attempted to rob Him of His due glory, yet God has provided a redemption in Christ. Man is in a desperate plight without the riches of God's righteousness; Erskine directs the attention of robbed and destitute souls to the Savior. Christ, having appeased divine justice, pours out His blessings upon men with the streams of His righteousness. "The eternal Son of God having a delight in the sons of men, and beholding, them in this miserable plight... in the fullness of time, he comes, and is manifested to destroy the works of the devil, and to recover all the stolen goods; he spoiled principalities and powers, and triumphed over them in his cross."

Descrição: This booklet opens with the story of Jesus and His disciples crossing the Sea of Galilee where Jesus rebukes the wind and waves of a deadly storm (Mark 4:37-40). According to J. C. Ryle, this story is full of instruction for all of us. He explains under five headings what we are to learn: 1) Christ’s service will not secure us against troubles, 2) the Lord Jesus Christ is truly man as well as God, 3) believers may have much weakness, yet still be true believers, 4) Christ has all power, and 5) Christ is full of kindness towards His people. Ryle ends with a description of his purpose in writing: “I want believers to know Jesus better that they may be more happy, more holy, and more meet (fit) for the inheritance of the saints in light.”

Descrição: Though the Law itself is not changed, and cannot be changed in itself or in its claims, our relation to the Law, and the Law's relation to us, is altered upon our believing on Him Who is "the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth" (Rom 10:4). Bonar shows that love is guided by the Law as the expression of the will of our Beloved. Obedience to the Law is true liberty for the believer. As believers, we are no longer in bondage, but in the spirit of adoption and filial love we are freed to obey the Law, even as the Son of God obeyed it.

Título: Salvation Taken into God's Own Hands
Autor: Edward Griffin
Descrição: In this tract, Edward Griffin (1770-1837) speaks of God’s plan of salvation conceived before the dawn of time. According to Griffin, every aspect of this plan was taken into God’s own hands, motivated by nothing but His own glory and compassion for a ruined world. Included was sending His Son to bear the sins of many, enlightening the world by gospel preaching, insuring the salvation of His elect and their sanctification, and creating and preserving His Church. Furthermore, every part of this was brought about independently of His creatures. Indeed, had God not taken salvation into His own hands, not a single fallen creature would ever have reached the kingdom of heaven. Griffin concludes by urging believers to leave all of their concerns to God, and entreating impenitent men to “seek ye the Lord while He may be found.”

Título: Sanctification
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: According to J. C. Ryle, sanctification is not optional, as some believe, but absolutely critical because if we are not sanctified, “we shall not be saved.” He goes on to give a detailed definition of sanctification by expanding on the 12 Scripturally-based statements below. Sanctification is—1) the result of our union with Christ, 2) a consequence of regeneration, 3) certain evidence of the indwelling Spirit, 4) a sure mark of God’s election, 5) a thing that will always be seen, 6) a thing for which every believer is responsible, 7) a thing which grows, 8) a thing which depends on diligent use of Scriptural means, 9) a thing which does not exempt one from inward spiritual conflict, 10) a thing which cannot justify a man, yet pleases God, 11) a thing which will be absolutely necessary in the Final Judgment, and 12) a thing that is required to prepare us for heaven.

Título: Sanctification
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In his book entitled 
Holiness, 
J. C. Ryle says, "If the Bible is true, it is certain that unless we are 'sanctified,' we shall not be saved." Throughout history, confusion has surrounded the doctrine of sanctification because finding the biblical balance in this subject is not easy. Some utterly reject a place for God's Law in the life of New Covenant believers, while others love God's Law and find it a blessed rule of life. 
 
In this edition of the Free Grace Broadcaster, A. W. Pink introduces our subject by asking crucial questions that inevitably arise regarding sanctification. Octavius Winslow offers a useful definition of the meaning of sanctification. J. C. Ryle then discusses the nature of sanctification, giving us a survey of its important elements. Winslow gives us a second article, explaining that all sanctification begins in Christ: His cross and atoning work, His intercession, and His Mediatorial fullness all lay the foundation and secure the sanctification of every believer. John Murray discusses the vital distinction between definitive and progressive sanctification. In his second article, Pink describes the two aspects of sanctification: mortification and vivification, both inseparable in the life of God's true children. Abraham Booth sets the motive of sanctification before us. Pink shows the difference between sanctification and justification. In two articles, Horatius Bonar shows us that holiness consists of the little things of life, and urges us to shine forth in reflection of Christ's glorious holiness.

Autor: W. A. Mason
Descrição: W. A. Mason expounds on Satan’s numerous methods in deceiving the saints “because he is a liar and the father of lies” (John 8:44). Below are some points emphasized in a summary by the author.
 
Satan is a great, strong, and wise enemy of God in this world and he is always working with an artfulness and cunning peculiar to himself.
 
The particular objects of his evil designs are believers who are diligently trying to stay loyal to God’s truth.
 
As we look at our human weakness and ignorance, and compare them with Satan’s greatness, wisdom and enmity, how easy it is to see that our only safety is in Christ.
 
In the end, Mason quotes James 4:7 which he calls “one little passage which is the divine direction” for opposing Satan. It has three simple points: submit to God, resist the devil, he will flee.

Título: Satan and His Gospel
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: A. W. Pink provides a thoroughly biblical description of Satan including his existence as a personal being, his origin, his fall, and his position since he fell. Pink then concentrates on Satan’s counterfeit gospel which so closely resembles the real gospel that multitudes are deceived. It is not revolutionary nor is it obviously heretical, but aims at “peace and unity.” Toning down the true gospel’s offensive doctrines and smoothing its rough edges, Satan’s gospel has great appeal to the carnal mind. Sadly, many who are deluded by it will in the end hear the most terrifying words, “I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” Pink concludes with timely advice for us all, “How necessary it is then to find out where we really are; to examine ourselves and see whether we be in the faith.”

Título: Satan Considering the Saints
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Have you ever thought about how Satan sizes up the saints as he prepares a temptation? Charles Spurgeon has. In this sermon, he takes as his text Job 1:8 where the Lord questions Satan, asking if he has considered His servant Job. Spurgeon shares his thoughts about how Satan carries out his work and what he considers about his prey. Satan aims to find any vulnerability that will allow him to further his intent to injure the saint and spoil his usefulness, among other malevolent designs. He considers potential weak points including our infirmities, our state of mind, the objects of our affection, our position among men, and our condition in the world. So what is the outcome? The Lord, in His sovereignty and lovingkindness, limits how far Satan can go while sustaining and sanctifying His children in the midst of their trials.

Descrição: “People do not want the Bible, because the One Who speaks to us in its pages is the 
Lord
 Jesus Christ. It is always so inconvenient to bow the knee to serve and follow Him. It will mean that we must take up the cross every day, denying ourselves and walking in His steps (Mat 16:24). That is the reason why men do not believe in Him. It is not because of lack of evidence, not because of the inadequacy of the Bible, not because there are no miracle workers in this century; it is because men and women do not want God. It was the people who saw Jesus’ miracles who cried ‘crucify Him.’ The nine of the ten men healed of leprosy could still not be bothered to give any doxology to the Lord (Luk 17:12-19). God has given this Word as the means of sinners’ salvation. Then let us be satisfied with it, heed it, and obey.”

Título: Scofield or the Scriptures
Autor: Paul Sisco
Descrição: Scofield or the Scriptures
 
is a thorough comparison between the Holy Bible and selected notes by C.I. Scofield from the
 Scofield Reference Bible
 of 1917. It traces Scofield’s original thoughts and holds them to the light of the Scriptures. The result shows the unorthodoxy in method and substance of the whole system of dispensationalism.
 
Cyrus Ingerson Scofield (1843-1921) was an American theologian, minister, and writer. He first trained as a lawyer and was elected to the Kansas legislature in 1871. He converted to evangelical Christianity in 1879 and came under the mentorship of Pastor James H. Brookes, a prominent dispensationalist premillennialist. In 1883 Scofield accepted the pastorate of a small congregational church in Dallas, Texas, which grew from fourteen to over five hundred members by 1895, when he became pastor of Moody’s church and headed Moody’s Northfield Bible Training School in Northfield, Massachusetts. When the 
Scofield Reference Bible
 was published in 1909, it quickly became the most influential statement of dispensational premillennialism and had a great impact throughout the world.

Título: Scripture, The
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: The Bible is among other things a book of revealed truth. That is, certain facts are revealed that could not be discovered by the most brilliant mind. These facts are of such a nature as to be past finding out. They were hidden behind a veil, and until certain men who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost took away that veil, no mortal man could know them. This lifting of the veil of unknowing from undiscoverable things we call divine revelation.
 
 The Bible, however, is more than a volume of hitherto unknown facts about God, man and the universe. It is a book of exhortation based upon those facts. By far the greater portion of the book is devoted to an urgent effort to persuade people to alter their ways and bring their lives into harmony with the will of God as set forth in its pages.
 
 No man is better for knowing that God in the beginning created the heavens and the earth. The devil knows that, and so did Ahab and Judas Iscariot. No man is better for knowing that God so loved the world of men that he gave his only begotten Son to die for their redemption. In hell there are millions that know that. Theological truth is useless until it is obeyed. The purpose behind all doctrine is to secure moral action.
 
 What is generally overlooked is that truth as set forth in the Christian Scriptures is a moral thing; it is not addressed to the intellect only, but to the will also. It addresses itself to the total man, and its obligations cannot be discharged by grasping it mentally. Truth engages the citadel of the human heart and is not satisfied until it has conquered everything there. The will must come forth and surrender its sword. It must stand at attention to receive orders, and those orders it must joyfully obey. Short of this any knowledge of Christian truth is inadequate and unavailing.
 
 Bible exposition without moral application raises no opposition. It is only when the hearer is made to understand that truth is in conflict with his heart that resistance sets in. As long as people can hear orthodox truth divorced from life they will attend and support churches and institutions without objection. The truth is a lovely song, become sweet by long and tender association; and since It asks nothing but a few dollars, and offers good music, pleasant friendships, and a comfortable sense of well-being, it meets with no resistance from the faithful. Much that passes for New Testament Christianity is little more than objective truth sweetened with song and made palatable by religious entertainment…

They testify to the wondrous perfections of His person, the varied glories of His offices, the sufficiency of His finished work. Apart from the Scriptures, He cannot be known. In them alone He is revealed...The measure in which we profit from our reading and study of the Scriptures may be ascertained by the extent to which Christ is becoming more real and more precious unto our hearts."

But there is no ground for this in the Holy Scriptures. The same Gospel that declares salvation to be freely by the grace of God through faith in the blood of Christ...also assures us, that without holiness no man shall see God" (A. Carson). Here A. W. Pink shows us the place, necessity, nature, and importance of good works in the life of a Christian.

Pink looks at God's demands upon man and man's failure to meet God's demands before he brings us to God's full provision for meeting His demands. We are called to love God's commandments and yield ourselves to them.

Prayer is the breath of the new nature in the saint, as the Word of God is its food."  The Word of God guides the Christian in prayer. Pink brings out the need for the Spirit's help in prayer and pleading God's promises. "We are profited from the Scriptures when prayer becomes 
a real and deep joy. 
Merely to 'say' our prayers each morning and evening is an irksome task...But to come into the conscious presence of God, to behold the glorious light of His countenance, to commune with Him at the mercy seat, is a foretaste of the eternal bliss awaiting us in heaven."

In this short tract, James urges all of us to examine our spiritual state, “frequently, deliberately, solemnly, and impartially.” Explaining that it is not enough to trust one’s own examination, he also implores us to beseech God about our real condition. In conclusion James writes, “If you are not converted, you may be. God is as willing to forgive the sin of a false profession as the sin of no profession. Now repent, now believe, now hope…”

Título: Self-Examination
Autor: Thomas Watson
Descrição: According to Thomas Watson, self-examination is a spiritual inquisition, bringing one’s self to trial. The rule by which one must try himself is the Word of God. Because man naturally loves himself, this is a difficult task. Men are reluctant to look into their hearts lest they should find that which they don’t want to deal with—but it must be done. If we do not try ourselves, we can never know how it is with us. In the end, God will try us—and His trial will be according to truth.
Whether our inquiry of ourselves proves we are truly God’s children or still in our sin-cursed condition, either discovery will be to our great advantage. If we find we have not grace, then the mistake is discovered, and the danger prevented. If we find we have grace, we may take comfort from the fact that we are heirs to “all the promises and in a state of salvation.”

Men must believe that Jesus Christ, the eternal "I AM" is God, one with the Persons of the Father and Holy Spirit. For "we must die in our sins, unless we believe the self-existence of Jesus Christ." Romaine encourages the soul with the hope of salvation in Christ the Lord who is dependent on none and whom His people may depend on for all salvation.

Descrição: Pastor Seth Payson preached this insightful sermon on loving God in April 1812. Reminding us that Christ gave this as the first and great commandment, Payson offers nine characteristics of true love to God: 1) a just view of His character, 2) love for His law, 3) rejoicing in His government, 4) love for His children, 5) love for advancing His kingdom, 6) frequent and joyful thoughts of Him, 7) delight in the ways He manifests Himself, 8) a disposition to keep His commandments, and 9) deep humiliation for past transgressions. By way of application, Payson poses a question that we would do well to ask ourselves: “The love of God is one grand characteristic of His children in distinction from the unbelieving world. Are we possessed of it?”

Título: Sick Man Left Behind, The
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: A sermon on 2 Timothy 4:20.  "These are among the last words of Paul the Apostle, for we find them in the closing verses of the last of his epistles. The chapter reminds us of a dying man’s final adieu to his best beloved friend, in the course of which he calls to mind the associates of his life. Among his memories of love we find Paul recollecting Trophimus, who had frequently shared with him the perils of rivers and perils of robbers which so largely attended the apostle’s career. He had left the good man ill at Miletum, and as Timothy at Ephesus was within an easy journey of him, there was no need to add a hint that he would visit him, for he would be sure to do it. The love of Jesus works in the hearts of His disciples great tenderness and unity. The overflow of our Lord’s great soul has saturated all His true followers with brotherly affection: because Jesus has loved Paul, Paul loves Timothy, and Timothy must needs love Trophimus. From this love there arises communion of feeling, so that in sympathy they share each other’s joys and griefs. When one member rejoices the body rejoices, and when one member suffers the whole body suffers with it. Trophimus is sick, and Paul cannot forget him, though he himself expects in a few weeks to die a martyr’s death. Neither would he have Timothy ignorant of the fact, though twice within a few verses he hurries him to come to Rome, saying, “Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me” (2Ti 4:9). If Timothy could not personally visit the sick friend, yet it was well that he should know of his affliction, for he would then remember him in his prayers. “Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God” (1Jo 4:7). Let us remember those who are one with us in Christ, and especially let us bear on our hearts all those who are afflicted in mind, body, or estate. If we have had to leave Trophimus at Miletum, or at Brighton, or at Ventnor, let us leave our heart’s love with him. And if we hear that another Trophimus lies sick not far from our own abode, let us accept the information as in itself a sufficient summons to minister to the afflicted friend. May holy sympathy pervade all our souls, for, however active and zealous we may be, we have not yet reached a perfect character unless we are full of compassion, tender-hearted, and considerate of the sorrowful, for this is the mind of Christ."

Descrição: None of us likes to be sick. But as J. C. Ryle points out, sickness, like the sin that caused it, is universal to all mankind. And while sickness is indeed a misery, Ryle shows that, at the same time, it confers general benefits on mankind. He writes, “It is a blessing quite as much as a curse. It is a rough schoolmaster, I grant. But it is a real friend to man’s soul.” He goes on to describe some of the ways that God uses sickness for good and the special duties that its prevalence requires, concluding with some words of practical application. We can do no better than to heed Ryle’s final exhortation, “In sickness and in health, in life and in death, let us lean confidently on Him.”

Título: Sinner's Friend, The
Autor: John Hall
Descrição: The Sinner's Friend
 proclaims the divine remedy for sin found in the mercies of Christ who came to save sinners by redeeming them from the power and condemnation of sin. In this book the sinner is reminded of the desperately wicked nature of his sin, the certainty of future judgment, and the ability of Christ to save according to the sufficiency of His sacrifice. The very essence of the gospel is the salvation of sinners.
 
"Will He not then have mercy upon thee, thou poor polluted, self-condemned, despairing sinner? Oh, yes, He surely will—for He delighteth in mercy; it is His darling attribute; therefore it is as impossible for you to be lost, as it is impossible for God to cease to exist, if you do but come in the right way, by Jesus Christ, the Sinner’s Friend, who is now pleading your cause before the throne of God."

Título: Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God
Autor: Jonathan Edwards
Descrição: Preached at Enfield, Connecticut on July 8, 1741, this is perhaps the greatest sermon ever preached in America—and is certainly among the most well known. Owing to its forthright dealing with God’s wrath and His intense hatred of sin and the sinner, it is also one of the most controversial. Indeed, for more than three-quarters of the sermon Edwards lays down a relentless stream of the most vivid and horrifying descriptions of the danger facing unregenerate men. While it is difficult to read such graphic language, there is abundant hope in the sermon’s conclusion. Edwards puts it this way, “And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open and stands calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners.”
 
While those who would rather ignore God’s justice in favor of His mercy condemn Edwards and his sermon, those who were present and actually heard him preach that day reacted in a decidedly different manner. According to the diary of Reverend Stephen Williams who attended the sermon, “Before the sermon was done there was a great moaning and crying through the whole House, ‘what shall I do to be saved; oh, I am going to hell, etc.’” The diary goes on to indicate that Edwards had to interrupt his sermon and come down to minister to those who were under such awful conviction. And so, in spite of what the scoffers might think or say, “the amazing and astonishing power of God” was manifested among the people that day—with many falling not into the hands of an angry God, but into the arms of a mighty Savior.

Título: Sins of Saints, The
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: “In every born again person there are two natures—the old and the new—the flesh and the spirit—which the apostle Paul tells us are contrary in the disposition, continually warring against each other.” Thus, A. W. Pink introduces this booklet which examines the subject of indwelling sin. He goes on to point out that since the old carnal nature remains in the believer as long as he continues in the body, there is always the possibility of his sinning. Pink addresses this important issue under four headings: a) one overtaken in a fault, b) the impossibility of a true believer being eternally lost, c) the consequences of a believer sinning, and d) preservation and perseverance of the saints.

Descrição: Expounding on Proverbs 11:30—"
He that winneth souls is wise
"—Charles Spurgeon begins this sermon with an encouraging word, “You can each of you, if grace enables you, be thus wise and win the happiness of turning souls to Christ through the Holy Spirit.” He goes on to shed light on the term “win” using several metaphors including warfare, wrestling, love, and finally 
the art
 of winning souls. Spurgeon next shows ways in which souls are won. He speaks first to preachers, urging them to believe in—and look for—instantaneous conversions and not to stray from the simple story of the cross. Lastly, addressing those who sit in the pews, he offers several practical suggestions including: bringing others to church, speaking to people one on one, writing letters, living the gospel, and praying.

Título: Sovereignty of God in Providence, The
Autor: John Reisinger
Descrição: “There are six basic principles surrounding the 
sovereignty of God in providence
 that run all the way through the Word of God and undergird its message of salvation. It is essential to understand and believe these principles in order to have a biblical understanding of God Himself and how to respond to His doings in your life. Grasping and applying these truths to your everyday life is the foundation of biblical hope that leads to true joy in the Lord...
 
1. God has a definite plan and purpose for the world.
 
2. God is always in control of all things and is constantly at work accomplishing His plan.
 
3. God controls and uses everyone, even the devil, in working out His plan.
 
4. God punishes the people that He uses to accomplish His purposes when they act out of wrong motives.
 
5. All things are from God, but the devil is the agent of all evil.
 
6. Although all sickness and affliction are part of God’s purposes and under His sovereign control, it does not follow that all sickness and affliction are necessarily chastisement for sin.”

Descrição: Pink's classic work on divine sovereignty.
 
“Present day conditions call loudly for a new examination and new presentation of God’s omnipotence, God’s sufficiency, God’s sovereignty. From every pulpit in the land it needs to be thundered forth that God still lives, that God still observes, that God still reigns. Faith is now in the crucible; it is being tested by fire, and there is no fixed and sufficient resting-place for the heart and mind but in the 
Throne of God.
 What is needed now, as never before, is a full, positive, constructive setting forth of the Godhood of God.”—
from the Introduction

Título: Spiritual Faith and Outward Profession
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this brief tract, A. W. Pink examines the difference between a mere outward profession of faith and the true faith that is given by a sovereign act of God. According to Pink, “The natural man, no matter how religious or orthodox he be” does not possess this true faith and no labor or decision on his part will cause him to acquire it. He continues by showing how this difference is evident in several spheres of Christian living which include reading the Scriptures, listening to the Word preached, prayer, conversing about the things of God, living a godly life, and passing out of this present world. Pink ends by showing in a few words what distinguishes a genuine Christian from one who is Christian in name only—not mere head knowledge, but a “God-given, Spirit-wrought faith in the heart.”

Título: Spiritual Peace
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: In this booklet, Charles Spurgeon expounds on the spiritual peace of believers, which is peace with God and peace with our own conscience. First, he describes the solid groundwork of this peace and its noble character. Next, he discusses its effects—joy, love, desire for holiness, help in bearing affliction, and boldness at God’s throne. He goes on to deal with interruptions of this peace, which include temptations of Satan, ignorance of true doctrine, unconfessed sin, and unbelief. Finally, Spurgeon gives good counsel on maintaining and gaining peace with God. To maintain it, one does well to look always to the cross of Christ, walk humbly with God, and walk in holiness, avoiding every appearance of evil. And for those who have never had peace with God, Spurgeon implores them, “Seek this peace and pursue it; and above all, seek the Peace-Maker, Christ Jesus, and you will be saved.”

 is an indepth study on the topics of union and communion within the Godhead, in the person of Christ, and between Christ and His church. The church’s union with Christ is shown in its various steps or stages, of mediatorial, mystical, federal, vital, saving, practical, and experimental, culminating at the glory union in the glories of heaven. In his Introduction, Pink states, “The present writer has not the least doubt in his mind that the subject of spiritual union is the most important, the most profound, and yet the most blessed of any that is set forth in the sacred Scriptures; and yet, sad to say, there is hardly any which is now more generally neglected.”

Título: Spurgeon's Catechism
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Spurgeon edited the Baptist Catechism for his own congregation in 1855, when he was 21 years old. On October 14, 1855, Charles Spurgeon preached Sermon No. 46 to several thousand gathered to hear him at New Park Street Chapel. The sermon publication contained an announcement of this Catechism. The text that morning was: “Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations” (Psa 90:1).
 
“I am persuaded that the use of a good Catechism in all our families will be a great safeguard against the increasing errors of the times, and therefore I have compiled this little manual...for the use of my own church and congregation. Those who use it in their families or classes must labor to explain the sense; but the words should be carefully learned by heart, for they will be understood better as years pass. May the Lord bless my dear friends and their families evermore…”—
C. H. Spurgeon
 
The 
Baptist Catechism
 
was written in 1693 by William Collins and Benjamin Keach for teaching the doctrines of the London Baptist Confession of 1689
.
 By 1738, this catechism was adopted by the Philadelphia Association of Baptists in America, the spiritual parent of all Baptist churches in the USA. Spurgeon edited and reprinted it in 1855, shortening the expositions of the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer. Thus, the catechism you hold in your hand is in essence the one used by Baptists in English-speaking countries to train their families for the last 300 years!

Descrição: In this booklet, Charles Spurgeon encourages those who struggle with an overactive conscience—specifically, those believers who long to know and be cleansed of their iniquities, and those unbelievers who think they must have a deeper conviction of sin before they can trust in Christ. Spurgeon’s message consists of Scriptural consolation and instruction, a caution not to confuse the work of the Spirit and the work of the devil, and finally an exhortation to those who are struggling to trust in Christ. He concludes by urging the latter to simply “Come as you are! Take Christ to be your all in all now.”

Título: Subjection under God's Chastisement
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this tract, A. W. Pink sets forth the believer’s proper response to God’s chastisement. All people are born into this world with an evil nature which manifests itself in a spirit of insubordination. Even after conversion, this rebellious nature is not entirely eradicated. Because of this, chastisement is needed to bring us into subjection to the Father. Pink examines various aspects of this subjection:
First, it denotes an acquiescence to God’s sovereign right to do with us as He pleases.
Second, it implies a renunciation of self-will.
Third, it acknowledges God’s righteousness and wisdom in dealing with us.
Fourth, it includes a recognition of His care and love for us.
Fifth, it involves an active performance of His will.
In the end, Pink reveals the two main reasons for this subjection—because He is our Father and because this is the secret of true happiness.

Título: Substitution
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: Lying at the heart of the Bible's blessed Gospel message are the themes of sin, death, God's holiness, justice, wrath, and 
the substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus Christ. 
This is why Paul wrote, "Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures" (1Co 15:3). Charles Spurgeon introduces this glorious subject of 
Substitution, 
proclaiming the heart of the Gospel
. 
Arthur Pink instructs us regarding the covenantal aspect of Christ's substitutionary work. Spurgeon then masterfully explains the Great Exchange: the believing sinner's sin and guilt laid upon Christ; Christ's righteousness upon believing sinners. Pink then carefully explains how Christ's substitution is a 
penal 
work. Octavius Winslow reveals how Christ's bloody substitution accomplished an entire pardon for His people. Piling up one Scripture upon another, John Owen gives us a delightful outline and summary of the Bible's revelation of sacrifice and substitution. Finally, Jonathan Edwards magnifies the wisdom of God in the vicarious work of Christ.

As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so the consolations of Christ abound. God uses our afflictions for our good and His glory. Ultimately they will be compensated btblBooks2]y the "glory which shall be revealed in us." They are used by God to purify us of sin. God is calling us to glorify Him in the fire, knowing that all His works are right.

Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Charles Spurgeon makes two major points in this tract about suffering. First, whenever trials come into a believer’s life they are always balanced by an equal measure of consolation. Second, suffering always brings benefits that cannot be realized any other way. As Spurgeon puts it, God’s children need a tether to keep them from straying, so “God binds them with afflictions, to keep them near to him, to preserve them…”

Título: Suppose an Unholy Man Were to Go to Heaven
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: Suppose 
for a moment that you were allowed to enter heaven without holiness. What would you do? What enjoyment could you find there? And what would you have in common with the saints of God? Surely their pleasures are not your pleasures and their tastes are not your tastes. With this, J. C. Ryle begins this little tract. He goes on to consider the reader’s preferences—perhaps you love the company of the worldly-minded, the pleasure-seeker, and the profane. There will be 
no
 such people in heaven. Perhaps you think that believers are too strict and serious and would rather avoid them. These will be the 
only
 people in heaven. Ryle reminds of the Scripture: “Without holiness no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 
12:14
). And he pointedly asks the reader, “Are you holy?”

Autor: William Reid
Descrição: In this short booklet, William Reid tells the touching story of young Mary Ann Whyte, a teacher’s daughter in Inverness-shire, Scotland. Mary Ann died rejoicing in Jesus Christ at the early age of seventeen. Relating several conversations leading up to her death, Reid’s story demonstrates her remarkable faith. For example, two days before she died she said to her father, “I know that death’s pangs are on me, but I fear it not. He (Jesus) was three hours in death’s pangs Himself, and should He leave me the same time, I’ll get home at one o’clock; and oh, what a joyful hour.” As those of her household gathered around, her last request was this: “I have called you that I might see you once more, and exhort you for the last time to make 
sure
 of your interest in Jesus. 
Take
 Him, and you shall be happy in life and in death.”

Título: Ten Commandments from the Westminster Larger Catechism
Autor: the Westminster Divines
Descrição: During the early 1600s, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists suffered repeated cycles of persecution at the hands of the Church of England and the crown. The Puritans arose to defend Biblical worship. During the resulting civil war (1642-1649), hierarchical parishes and bishops were abolished by the then Puritan Parliament. A special assembly was appointed to draft a new structure; it met at the historic Westminster Abbey (adjoining the Houses of Parliament) in London. The Westminster Assembly held 1,163 sessions between July 1, 1643, and February 22, 1649.
 
This 
Westminster Confession
 was drafted for the Church of England, and has become the most important of the great Protestant creeds of the Reformation era. It is a summary of major Christian beliefs in thirty-three chapters. Classic reformed biblical theology permeates the confession, with emphasis on the covenant relationships between God and man. A 
Larger Catechism
 was prepared by the Westminster Assembly, to be used by ministers in the pulpit for public teaching (1648). A 
Shorter Catechism
 was published for instructing children.

Título: Thankfulness
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: "I will extol thee my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness" (Psa 145:1-6). The subject of this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster was chosen in 2004 after the devastation of Hurricane Ivan, in thankfulness to God for sparing Chapel Library. We pray it will be used by God to enflame your heart with thanksgiving to our great God. William Cooper, a Puritan preacher about whom little is known, introduces the theme of thankfulness by declaring why all men should be thankful. In another article he teaches us how to give thanks in everything, even affliction. Richard Sibbes, who inspired men such as John Cotton and David Martyn Lloyd-Jones, briefly describes thankfulness as the disposition of God's people. Thomas Manton explains the holy duty of thankfulness, while John Gill, with characteristic thoroughness, lists a catalogue of Christ-centered reasons for thanking the Triune God. In a message originally delivered to seamen, John Flavel shows how to give thanks for the mercies God has lavished upon us. Charles Spurgeon gives us three articles this time: he exhorts us to give thanks even in times of difficulty and then exposes ingratitude as a sin for which there is no excuse. He finally preaches from the story of the ten lepers whom Christ healed, in which only one returned to thank Him. We pray with all our hearts that your souls will be moved by this Broadcaster to greater and continual thankfulness to our merciful God. He has delivered our souls for ever in Christ Jesus. "In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you" (1Th 5:18).

Título: The Atonement
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In his excellent work, 
The Attraction of the Cross
, Gardiner Spring said, “By the Christian atonement, I understand that satisfaction to divine justice made by the sufferings and death of Christ, in the room and stead of sinners, in virtue of which pardoning mercy is secured to all who believe the gospel.” This is a beautiful and concise definition of Christ’s redemptive work; nevertheless, these are fighting words in much of the religious world today. “Satisfaction to divine justice made by the sufferings and death of Christ” implies propitiation and the wrath of God. Liberal theologians and other professing Christians vehemently reject such a notion. Likewise, coupled with “in the room and stead of sinners,” it implies penal substitution and vicarious atonement, which are hotly debated and denied by other professing Christians. And, “in virtue of which pardoning mercy is secured to all who believe the gospel” implies election and particular redemption—doctrines utterly despised by some professing evangelicals. Much more could be said about and mined from this theologically rich definition, but the point should be clear: professing Christians do not agree on what the design, intent, and accomplishment of Christ’s death are. This is a tragedy, which becomes clearer when we ponder C. H. Spurgeon’s statement: “I do not believe we can preach the gospel…unless we preach the sovereignty of God in His dispensation of grace; nor unless we exalt the electing, unchangeable, eternal, immutable, conquering love of Jehovah; nor do I think we can preach the gospel unless we base it upon the special and particular redemption of His elect and chosen people that Christ wrought out upon the cross.” 
 
Your view of Christ’s atonement affects the way you think about God and His eternal purpose, the Person and work of Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit, and the way we preach the gospel—if indeed we are actually 
preaching
 the gospel. We earnestly pray that every reader will consider the work of Christ as we believe Scripture presents it and as some of the greatest preachers, evangelists, and missionaries that the world has ever known have preached it. Not all will agree with the contents of this FGB; but may we all love, praise, and adore the sovereign God of heaven and earth for the redemption accomplished in the atonement of Jesus Christ the Lord. May the Lord Christ be forever praised: “Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation” (Rev 5:9).

Título: The Deity of Christ
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: Robert Lewis Dabney wrote, “Here we come to the prime article of revealed theology, a doctrine of deep significance. What we think about Jesus Christ affects not only questions surrounding the subsistence of the Godhead, but it also delves into entirely relevant issues, such as whether or not one should trust, obey, and worship Christ as God, the nature and efficacy of His atoning offices, as well as what constitutes a Church and what are its rites. He who believes in the divinity of Jesus Christ is a Christian; he who does not (whatever his profession) is a mere Deist. Without the Divinity, the Bible is, ‘the drama of Hamlet, with the part of Hamlet omitted.’ ” I wonder if we believe Dabney’s statements; or if, in our heart of hearts, we wonder if he is exaggerating just a bit? Is the doctrine of Christ’s deity that important? Really?
 
If we believe that the Scriptures are the inspired, infallible Word of God, then Jesus Christ is the foundation, the essential truth, of all that we believe as Christians. Mark Jones writes, “In theology, Christology has an importance that cannot be overstated. Christ’s person and work are the central point of Christian theology.” “Cannot be overstated”—it appears that Dabney and Jones agree on the importance of the 
person
 of Christ, especially the crucial doctrine of the 
deity
 of Christ. In fact, to ask, “Who is Jesus Christ?” is to ask the fundamental question that lies at the very heart of Western history. It is impossible to imagine that Christianity would ever have spread throughout the ancient world without one central truth burning like the sun at noonday—the man who died on Calvary’s cross and rose again the third day was and is truly and fully deity. “Jesus Christ is God” is the thought that changed the world 
forever
.
 
It would have been interesting to hear the tone of voice with which Charles Spurgeon delivered the following statement: “I cannot see how Jesus Christ can be anything but one of two things—either the Son of God or else a gross impostor who allowed his disciples to think him divine and used the virtues of his character to support his claim…Either God or an arch-deceiver he must have been.”
 
At Chapel Library, we believe with all our hearts that from Genesis to Revelation the Holy Scriptures teach that Jesus Christ is God. Antitrinitarians and cults, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses; atheists and agnostics, such as Bart Ehrman; and numerous others have relentlessly attacked Christ’s deity. We therefore present the latest issue of the 
Free Grace Broadcaster
—
The Deity of Christ. 
Numerous challenges presented themselves in bringing these articles together. Some of the most thorough articles in systematic theologies were highly technical, and unfortunately, often dry as dust! Such a glorious subject should fill our hearts with wonder, praise, and adoration rather than being an antidote for a sleepless night. On the other hand, articles that were more readable did not always deal thoroughly with the profound questions that have arisen over the centuries regarding this weighty and controversial subject. The resolution was to find readable articles and to move technical information to the footnotes; therefore, our readers will find more footnotes than usual. The subject was and is too vast and profound to cover well in forty-eight pages, so this FGB is merely a primer. Nevertheless, we pray with all our hearts that the reader will see something of the glory and beauty of the Word made flesh as these pages unfold.
 
The Puritan Isaac Ambrose introduces this FGB by declaring that one cannot find a more excellent subject to talk or write about than the person of Jesus Christ. Charles Hodge then gives us a brief survey of the OT teaching regarding Christ’s deity. Another Puritan, Thomas Brooks, demonstrates Christ’s deity by examining the honors due to God that the biblical writers bestow upon Jesus. Octavius Winslow examines the attributes and names of...

Título: The Doctrine of Sanctification
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: The Doctrine of Sanctification 
is one of Pink’s most insightful books, which is a high commendation indeed! In it he deals with the Biblical answers to the following questions poised in the Introduction, and more. “What is ‘sanctification’: is it a quality or position? Is sanctification a legal thing or an experimental?—that is to say, is it something the believer has in Christ or in himself? Is it absolute or relative?—by which we mean, does it admit of degree or no? Is it unchanging or progressive? Are we sanctified at the time we are justified, or is sanctification a later blessing? How is this blessing obtained?—by something which is done for us, or by us, or both? How may one be assured he has been sanctified: what are the characteristics, the evidences, the fruits? How are we to distinguish between sanctification by the Father, sanctification by the Son, sanctification by the Spirit, sanctification by faith, sanctification by the Word?” May the reader be illumined by the Holy Spirit as he finds the answers herein!

Título: The Duty of Self-Denial
Autor: Thomas Watson
Descrição: Self-denial runs against the grain of our indulgent Western culture. “Self-denial lodges but in a few breasts. It is a sacred, exotic herb which has grown very scarce.” Modern misconception tends to relegate self-denial to an ancient world of monasteries, hair shirts, and self-flagellation. However, as Watson shows, there is nothing more Biblical or Christian than true self-denial. “Self-denial is the first principle of Christianity. It is the life-blood which must run through the whole body of religion.” Christ calls us to deny our wills, our own righteousness, our appetites, our ease, our inordinate passions, our relations, our estates, and even our lives for Him. There is no alternative to a life of self-denial: “There may be going to heaven without comfort, but there is no going there without self-denial.”

Título: The London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689 with Preface, Baptist Catechism, and Appendix on Baptism
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: The London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 played an important role in Baptist history. The Act of Uniformity of 1662 made the new Anglican Prayer Book mandatory for use in all Anglican, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Baptist churches in England. Moreover, the Anglican church abandoned the Westminster Confession and returned to the Thirty-Nine Articles as its official confession of faith. Consequently, with the restoration of the Monarchy, the English Baptists suffered persecution for their faith. In 1677, a group of Particular Baptists met for the purpose of producing a more expansive confession than the previous Baptist confession of 1644. They modeled the Second London Confession on the Westminster Confession, but with significant theological differences regarding church government and baptism. Persecution kept the 1677 document from being officially endorsed by Particular Baptists until 1689, when the Toleration Act was passed. This act enabled religious freedom to co-exist alongside the established churches in England and Scotland. As a result, representatives from over 100 Particular Baptist churches met in London from July 3-11 to discuss and endorse the 1677 document. Though the confession was published in 1677, the General Assembly of Particular Baptist Churches adopted it in 1689; hence it is commonly known as “the 1689.” The Westminster Confession, the Savoy Declaration, and the London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 are considered the most important Reformed confessions arising from the English-speaking world.

Título: The Sinfulness of Sin
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: The purpose of this collection of articles is to press our hearts to honestly consider before heaven the dreadfulness of sin and the only hope for its pardon—Jesus Christ.
 
Therefore, Arthur W. Pink begins with a brief, biblical definition of sin, followed by William S. Plumer’s excellent exposition of sin as an 
infinite
 evil. Pink offers us a second article, explaining that there is nothing so vile as sin, as he describes its nature. Puritan Thomas Watson teaches us from vivid biblical descriptions that sin is a heinous thing, worthy of God’s just curse; while another Puritan, Ralph Venning, labors to show us that the heart of the sinfulness of sin is its relentless opposition to God; in fact, Venning says that if it could, sin would “ungod God.” A third Puritan, Samuel Bolton compares 
natural
 evils—natural disasters such as plagues, hurricanes, and earthquakes—with 
moral
 evil—sin—to teach us that sin is the greatest evil known to man! Watson then takes on the vital issue of degrees of sin, for many in his day and ours are deluded into thinking that God does not view one sin as greater than another. Furthermore, many of us have weak views of sin, so Edward Payson helps us to see that our sins are infinite, innumerable, and monstrous; thankfully, he points us to Jesus Christ and His redemptive work on the cross as the only remedy for the plague of our hearts. Again, pointing us to Christ, J. C. Ryle explains with great clarity our need for repentance from sin and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Charles Spurgeon displays the unknown depths of human sin and convincingly reveals that we really do not know what we are doing when we sin against God. The last word is from Octavius Winslow, who shows us that the one place where we may see our sins in all their depraved wickedness is the cross of Jesus Christ: from that extraordinary light, we will see our sins as they really are.

Título: The Triune God
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: The infallible Word teaches us that God the Father purposed our salvation, God the Son accomplished our salvation, and God the Holy Spirit applies our salvation, according to the eternal purpose of God. The salvation of our immortal souls is trinitarian. And in this, we see a breathtaking beauty that humbles, comforts, and motivates God’s people.
 
With this in mind, we present this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster: 
The Triune God
...This subject is holy ground, one that we cannot take lightly. This doctrine is the foundational truth of our faith and therefore requires patient, careful reading and study. We may state the heart of the doctrine using Calvin’s simple sentence—“in the one essence of God there is a trinity of persons”—but to understand the depths of our infinite, holy Creator and Sovereign is beyond our human ability. So we have tried to offer 
readable
 articles, adding plenty of technical information in the footnotes for those who want to plunge in more deeply.

Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: From the Pastoral Letter
 -
 
“But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God” (Heb 10:12).
 
This is a stunning declaration! Without the light of the Holy Spirit, diligent study, and meditation, we can read these twenty-one words without our hearts being touched or our souls being enflamed to worship. Lord, forgive us of our dullness, our backwardness! Here in twenty-one words, we have the work of Jesus Christ summarized, the eternal purpose of God displayed in the eternal Son of God. Here are the glories of “this man”—Christ the Son, Christ the Mediator, Christ the Prophet, Christ the Priest, Christ the King—set before us in short form.
 
Here is the forgiveness of sins accomplished in “one sacrifice” forever. Here is everything infinitely necessary to save and keep God’s people for all eternity! Everything! Appointed in eternity before Creation, sent into the world, incarnate by the miraculous conception in the Virgin’s womb, obedient to the Law, crucified, resurrected, ascended into heaven, and seated in glorious splendor at the right hand of His Father—Christ completed the work that His Father decreed before the foundation of the world. Here is the Surety, here is the Substitute come to die in horrifying agony upon the cruel cross of Calvary and to rise again by omnipotent power on the third day, conquering death, hell, the world, and Satan.
 
Every aspect and every detail of everything His Holy Father gave Him to do in order to save His people from the penalty, the power, the pleasure, and the presence of sin—everything—Jesus Christ accomplished it all. Christ’s Person and work are the reason for history, the focus of the Bible, the object of saving faith, and the singular hope for eternal life and the future. Jesus Christ is the single most astounding reality in the universe.

Descrição: About 
Thoughts for Young Men
:  
“When St. Paul wrote his Epistle to Titus about his duty as a minister, he mentioned young men as a class requiring peculiar attention. After speaking of aged men and aged women, and young women, he adds this pithy advice—“Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded” (Tit 2:6). I am going to follow the Apostle’s advice. I propose to offer a few words of friendly exhortation to young men.
 
“I am growing old myself, but there are few things I remember so well as the days of my youth. I have a most distinct recollection of the joys and the sorrows, the hopes and the fears, the temptations and the difficulties, the mistaken judgments and the misplaced affections, the errors and the aspirations, which surround and accompany a young man’s life. If I can only say something to keep some young man in the right way, and preserve him from faults and sins, which may mar his prospects both for time and eternity, I shall be very thankful.” —

Descrição: In this booklet about prayer Pastor Shelton takes his theme from Acts 3:19, “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins be blotted out, when times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.” He steps through some specifics of prayer under five headings—Outpouring of the Holy Spirit, Intercessory Prayer, Definite Need and Assurance of Answer, God Beckons Us to Pray, and The Grounds of Assurance. In the end—and just before a set of questions for reflection and discussion—he challenges and encourages us, “So pray and keep on praying; our God hears and answers prayer.” And so He does.

Título: Treasury of David, The  (Classic series)
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: The Treasury of David
 was first published in monthly installments over a twenty year span in the London Metropolitan Tabernacle’s periodical, 
The Sword and the Trowel.
 Completed sections were released volume by volume, until the seventh and final volume was released in 1885. It is his 
magnum opus
 and has become one of Spurgeon’s most valued works. About it Spurgeon said in the preface: “The delightful study of the Psalms has yielded me boundless profit and ever-growing pleasure; common gratitude constrains me to communicate to others a portion of the benefit, with the prayer that it may induce them to search further for themselves. That I have nothing better of my own to offer upon this peerless book is to me a matter of deepest regret; that I have anything whatever to present is subject for devout gratitude to the Lord of grace. I have done my best, but, conscious of many defects, I heartily wish I could have done far better.” –

Descrição: Do you deny yourself? Our Lord makes self-denial an essential mark of every true disciple, yet it is little-understood and much-ignored in our self-gratifying age. 
A Treatise of Self-denial
 turns our attention again to Christ’s warning: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself” (Mat 16:24). The book is a Puritan classic: it is thorough, biblical, relevant, insightful, timeless, vital, God-honoring, convicting, and immensely important reading for every Christian. It is especially important for pastors, to restore to their preaching this fundamental doctrine. Manton skillfully and convincingly explores our need to deny self-dependence, self-will, self-love, and self-seeking. We pray your life will be transformed by reading and applying this exhortation.

Título: True Confessor, and the False
Autor: Horatius Bonar
Descrição: In this tract, Horatius Bonar presents what the Bible teaches about true and false confessions, noting that they both use the same words, “I have sinned,” yet they do not mean the same thing. He goes on to give Scriptural examples of those whose confession was self-serving and false, including Pharaoh, Saul, and Judas. Why were these confessions false? Because they were selfish, superficial, impulsive, and temporary. In true confession, the sinner—as far as he is able—comes to see sin as God sees it: a consummate evil and willful rebellion against God and His commandments. The truly repentant sinner draws near with an honest heart, in full assurance of faith, knowing that “if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins” (1 John 1:9).

Título: True Prayer - True Power!
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Here is a stirring call to greater and more fervent prayerfulness, which every Christian would do well to heed. In this sermon on Mark 11:24, Spurgeon shows that true prayer must have definite objects, an earnest desire, firm faith, and strong expectation. He applies these things to our prayer meetings and our personal prayer lives. "Look above, Christian brethren and sisters, and let us weep. O God, Thou hast given us a mighty weapon, and we have permitted it to rust. Thou hast given us that which is mighty as Thyself, and we have let that power lie dormant. Would it not be a vile crime if a man had an eye given him that he would not open, or a hand that he would not lift up, or a foot that grew stiff because he would not use it. And what must we say of ourselves when God has given us power in prayer, and yet that power lies still."

Título: True vs. False Gospel
Autor: Lee Roy Shelton, Jr.
Descrição: The True Gospel of Christ versus the False Gospel of Carnal Christianity
 
examines in detail the common modern message sometimes called “easy-believism,” where justification in Christ is presented without mention of one’s responsibility to forsake sin and live set apart from the world. This gospel holds that one may “make a decision” to “receive Christ,” without bowing to His authority over one’s life. The problem is that many conclude: “a little sin won’t hurt—I’m just carnal, and God has saved me any way.” This false gospel leaves the professing Christian without any power over sin and a false confidence in heaven, even to the point of resisting calls to repent because “I don’t need to; I’m already saved.” Romans 6 is used to develop a Biblical understanding of self-denial, and passages in 1 and 2 Timothy are used to explain the deceitful nature of selfish sin. Finally, the book explores the rich new life provided in the true Gospel of Scripture.

    “The real question of the present day is just this, Is man a totally and thoroughly depraved being by nature?...It is upon the 
truth
 of this doctrine that the whole Bible proceeds. Man being thoroughly depraved in nature, is it possible, I ask, to save him without a special and direct intervention of the Father, Son, and Spirit, in his behalf?...If you place the different 
errors 
of the day before you, you will find that they all more or less deny or encroach on the doctrine of man’s original, actual depravity. You will find, also, that the objections urged against God’s sovereignty and man’s helplessness, are just different manifestations of human pride…Man will not consent to be nothing, that God alone may be all!”                                                                                                                         —

Título: Turn or Burn
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Introducing the somber theme of this sermon, Charles Spurgeon points out how unpopular the doctrine of hell and eternal punishment was in his day—as it clearly is in ours. “I fear in too many places the doctrine of future punishment is rejected and laughed at…but the day will come when it will be known as a reality.” He goes on to explain the nature of repentance and addresses why it is necessary that God should punish men if they will not repent. Finally, consistent with its provocative title, Spurgeon ends his sermon with a precious promise and a blunt warning, “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned.”

Título: Unconditional Election
Autor: David Dye
Descrição: David Dye gives us a highly readable explanation of the doctrine of unconditional election. He notes that while this doctrine has been held by the church for ages, it is contrary to the inclination of the human heart. The only reason anyone believes it is because he finds it in the Bible. A brief overview: because of man’s depravity, he will never choose God. At the same time, God is not obligated to save any man. So how does anyone get saved? Before the foundation of the world, apart from any merit in man, God chose a definite number of individuals for salvation and gave them to His Son. This is election. It is a sovereign act of God, it is unchangeable, it is eternal, and it is unconditional—that is, based on pure grace and nothing else. Why did God do it this way? So He would get all the glory!

Título: Understanding the Times
Autor: Ken Ham
Descrição: Understanding the Times 
is timely and essential reading, because the western Church is in a free-fall of decline. Compromise has undermined the Bible, and the impact of this abandonment of belief in its authority is breaking like storm-driven waves on biblical evangelicalism. Once-thriving churches are being abandoned and transformed into dance studios, tattoo parlors, and nightclubs. Why? In this illustrated presentation, Ken Ham gives helpful insights into the reasons for this decline, which started with attacks on issues like the age of the earth and the accuracy of the history in Genesis. Ken shares how churches and individuals can stand against destructive, millions-of-years/evolution-based ideas and successfully rebuild the foundation of biblical authority in our culture.
 
Ken Ham
 is CEO and President of

Título: Unwritten Wonders of the Grace of Christ
Autor: Horatius Bonar
Descrição: In this message on John 21:25, Bonar considers what kind of wonderful works and words our Lord did above and beyond what are found written in holy Scripture. They were works of power, majesty, suffering, prayer, zeal, and pity. He closes with these thoughts: "Shall we not feel how well He deserved all our trust and love, how worthy He was of loudest praise, and honor, and blessing? Shall we not be ashamed to think that there actually was one period, nay, one day of our lives, when we did not love and trust and honor and praise Him? Shall we not be amazed to think, that one hard, one suspicious, one unbelieving thought, could ever have arisen within us? Shall we not be humbled at the remembrance of having so often treated with coldness, and disesteem, and neglect, this Being of beings, this Brother of brothers—so often brought dishonor upon this Name of names!"

Título: Useless Kinds of Religion
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: In this short tract, J. C. Ryle explains that there are two ways a man may lose his soul. By living and dying without any religion at all—a sure way to hell—and by contenting himself with a false Christianity. The latter, which he calls a useless kind of religion, is the most common way to hell for those who profess to be Christians. According to Ryle, useless religions take two forms: those in which Jesus Christ does not fill the principal place and those which join anything with Christ in the matter of saving one’s soul. His conclusion? It is “an awful thing to be content with a religion than can do you no good. Do not let this be your case!”

Descrição: Many Christians would agree that the conviction of sin should show a sinner his own wretchedness and need.  But how many would recognize the need for Christians themselves to see their vileness before God? While by God's justifying grace in Christ we are spotless in His sight, our flesh is still sinful, wretched, vile! Our imaginations, self-will, religious pretense, and unbelief all testify to this reality. A recognition of our vileness before God is essential to cultivating the humility and dependence on Christ that we so greatly need as believers.

 is a bold exhortation to those who do not know Jesus Christ, that they must urgently seek Him with all their hearts. “The Scriptures are full of these warnings…that if we miss Christ we have missed everything. Why? ‘For in Him are found all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,’ Colossians 2:3. In Him is found all that God holds dear for sinful man, because Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life—no man can come unto the Father and heaven but by Him.”

The faith which saves is a belief in a person, depending upon Jesus for eternal life. What is our warrant for coming to Christ? The gospel command is a sufficient warrant for a sinner to believe in Jesus Christ. This is the commandment, that ye “believe on his Son Jesus Christ.”

What Does It Mean to Preach Christ? 
challenges pastors in the vital focus of their ministry. “How far your ministry will be that of a faithful ‘steward of the mysteries of God’ will depend on how far it shall be the faithful preaching of Jesus Christ. No inquiry, therefore…should seem to you of such importance as that which seeks a full understanding of the work of preaching Christ Jesus our Lord and Saviour, according as it is taught in the Scriptures and set forth before us in the example of the Apostles. It is an inquiry with which the work of a minister of Christ will be more and more identified as he himself shall grow in the mind of his Master, and in a personal experience of the power and preciousness of the grace revealed in Him.”

Título: What Have I to Do with Idols?
Autor: Robert Murray McCheyne
Descrição: According to Robert Murray McCheyne if you have been born again, you will cry in your heart, “Lord, take the idols from me.” He goes on to describe seven major idols that every Christian should be aware of.
 
 
Self-righteousness. This is the idol that man loves most and God hates most. 
 
Darling sins. Every man has his pet sins.
 
Unlawful attachments. How many worship a piece of clay that will soon be eaten by worms! 
 
Ministers. You have good reason to love them, but make not an idol of them.
 
Earthly pleasures. This is a smiling, dazzling idol that has ruined millions. Money. You must not love money. 
 
Fear of man. This grim idol has devoured many souls and trampled them down into hell.
 
 
McCheyne sums it up this way: we belong to Christ now, so what have we to do any more with idols?

Título: What If I'm Not Elect?
Autor: Walter Marshall
Descrição: In this eight-page tract, Walter Marshall addresses an obstacle that hinders some in coming to Christ—uncertainty about whether they are among the elect. Attempting to dispel these fears, he appeals to a number of Bible verses including John 6:37, which affirms that all the Father has given to Christ will come to Him and equally affirms that all who come to Him He will in no wise cast out. In the end, Marshall assures these timid souls that it is not presumption, but one’s bound duty, to carry out the great work of believing on Christ for salvation—and this without questioning beforehand whether one is elect, for according to Deuteronomy 29:29, the secret things belong to God, but those things that are revealed belong to us, that we may do them.

? One must not make the assumption lightly that he or she is a true Christian. A false conclusion at this point is tragic and fatal. Therefore I want to set before you four strands of the Bible’s answer to the question: 
What is a Biblical Christian?

Título: What Is Freedom?
Autor: Billy Morrison
Descrição: Writing from a prison in Northern Ireland, Billy Morrison discusses freedom from the perspective of a prisoner. He points out that release from prison will never bring real freedom. It will simply be release from the physical bondage of a prison cell, but not from the spiritual bondage of sin—under which every human being lives from birth. He goes on to describe the real freedom that God mercifully provides. God's gift of freedom delivers us from our deadly bondage of sin. “When Jesus came to this earth, He came to set free all those who would repent and believe the gospel (Mark 1:15), to set them free from the bondage of sin and all that this brings.”

Descrição: George Whitefield wrote this letter to John Wesley in 1740, in response to Wesley's sermon entitled "Free Grace." Whitefield believed the issue vital to robust Christianity, and hastened to write from Georgia in the American colonies, to his friend across the sea.
 
From the Preface:
 
"Many of my friends, that are strenuous advocates of universal redemption, will immediately be offended. Many that are zealous on the other side will be much rejoiced. They that are lukewarm on both sides, and are carried away with carnal reasoning, will wish this matter had never been brought under debate...I heartily pray God to hasten the time for his being clearly enlightened into all the doctrines of divine revelation, that we may thus be closely united in principle and judgment as well as heart and affection."

Título: Why Men Will Not Come to Christ
Autor: Mahan
Descrição: Jesus said, “And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life…” (John 
5:40
). In this excellent tract, Henry Mahan examines the Scriptural basis for this sad truth. In the first place, sinners are spiritually blind because “the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not…” (2 Cor 4:4). Only the Father can draw men to the Son. Secondly, sinners are spiritually dead because of their sins. Before they can come to Christ they must be regenerated by God’s Spirit. Finally, men won’t come to Christ because they hate God’s terms, which have always been repentance and faith. They will not abandon their rebellion until God has stripped them of all their self-righteous rags. Mahan ends with this plea, “God give us preachers today who will rout the sinners out of their refuge of lies and exalt the God of the Bible.”

Título: Winter Afore Harvest
Autor: Joseph Charles Philpot
Descrição: J. C. Philpot compares the growth of grace to the stages of a shoot of vegetation. The spring of fresh regeneration brings its new bud of hope, and afterward it flowers into the summer of the peace of God. Yet the harvest does not directly follow. Philpot attests: "Harvest does not succeed summer in the kingdom of grace, as in the kingdom of nature. 'Afore the harvest' another season comes. A long and dreary winter intervenes, and with winter comes the pruning knife of the heavenly Husbandman, who purgeth the vine." But after the winter of trial's difficulties in the pruning of the Lord, it brings forth the harvest of spiritual fruit. The soul is edified as the Spirit of Christ moves upon the soul in His timing and working, bringing forth the fruit in His perfect seasons.

Título: Wisdom of God: Mystery of Redemption
Autor: James A. Haldane
Descrição: God has demonstrated His great wisdom in His redemption of men. In this booklet, the history of God's plan of redemption is reviewed with clarity as James Haldane considers God's glory demonstrated by the gospel of Christ. Though man's condition after he fell appeared absolutely hopeless, God in His all-knowing power provided the way for the salvation of men. Neither contradicting His own just attributes nor faltering in His redemptive purposes, "from  the  foundation  of  the  world;  from  the beginning  He  has  acted  on  a  plan,  originating  in  infinite  wisdom  and  perfect  goodness."

Título: Withered Fig Tree, The
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: In this sermon, Charles Spurgeon unfolds the gospel story of the withered fig tree. Going beyond the normal interpretation, he urges the congregation not to consider it only in relation to nations and churches, but to apply the lesson to their own lives, taking it “home each one to his own heart.” He goes on to consider the leafy—but fruitless—fig tree as a picture of those who profess faith in Christ, but show no fruit in their lives. He does this under three headings: there are such people in the church, these will be inspected by Jesus at the final judgment, and the results will be “very terrible.” Spurgeon concludes with a prayer that none of his hearers will suffer such a fate: “Holy Spirit, produce fruit in us this day, through faith in Jesus Christ our Lord!”

Título: Withering Work of the Holy Spirit, The
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Charles Spurgeon compares the work of the Holy Spirit in withering the flesh of men to the withering of grass in the field (Isaiah 40:6-8 and 1 Peter 1:23-25). He puts it this way, “In order to make room for the display of the divine glory in Christ Jesus and His salvation, there would come a withering of all the glory wherein man boasts himself.” According to Spurgeon, the Spirit’s withering prepares the soil for the sowing and implanting by which salvation is wrought. He then lays out seven observations regarding this work: it is very unexpected, it tears down in preparation for a new creation, it is universal and complete in this tearing down, it is painful, it is inevitable, and finally, it is a prelude to great happiness. In the end, Spurgeon assures us that the result of all this—eternal life in Christ—will never wither!

Autor: Lee Roy Shelton, Jr.
Descrição: An exposition of sin's great wickedness in the eyes of the holy God because it violates His Word. L. R. Shelton, Jr., examines the magnitude of the sinful depravity of mankind in consideration of the nature and effects of sin in its rendering the soul guilty and vile before God. In an earnest warning, Shelton attests that the violation of the law of God brings "us  on  a  collision  course  with  a  sin-hating,  sin-abhorring,  sin-punishing God Whom we must  meet either in mercy or judgment." The sinner is urged to turn from sin to salvation in saving repentance and faith in Christ.

Título: World Passeth Away, The
Autor: Horatius Bonar
Descrição: Horatius Bonar begins this tract by declaring “Ours is a dying world, and here we have no continuing city.” He contrasts this world with a world that does not pass away, which he describes as “fair and glorious…bright with the love of God, and the joy of heaven.” He goes on to employ a string of metaphors which describe the present vanishing world, including—like a dream of the night, a mist of the morning, or a fading flower. However, while this world is surely passing away, man is immortal. He will spend eternity either in great joy or in deep darkness and sorrow. So the critical question is this: how can a man make sure that his life after death will be spent in the light and joy of heaven? God has long since answered that question, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.”

Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: In this solemn tract, A. W. Pink tackles the subject of God’s wrath head on. In contrast to many Christians of his day (and even more so in our day), he doesn’t tone down or apologize for this thoroughly Biblical doctrine. Nor does he consider it a blot on God’s character. Indeed, he makes it clear that the wrath of God “is as much a Divine perfection as is His faithfulness, power, or mercy.” According to Pink, God’s wrath springs from His holiness and His inveterate hatred of sin. In the end, he admonishes each of us to be prayerfully on guard against devising an image of God that is rooted in our imagination rather than in the Scriptures.

Thus it is of Roman Catholic origin, brought over from paganism. But, says someone, Christmas is the time when we commemorate the Savior’s birth. It is? And who authorized such commemoration? Certainly God did not. The Redeemer bade His disciples remember Him in His death, but there is not a word in Scripture, from Genesis to Revelation, which tells us to celebrate His birth. Moreover, who knows when, in what month, He was born? The Bible is silent thereon. Is it without reason that the only birthday commemorations mentioned in God’s Word are Pharaoh’s (Gen 40:20) and Herod’s (Mat 14:6)? Is this recorded 'for our learning'? If so, have we prayerfully taken it to heart?"

Título: Ye Must Be Born Again!
Autor: Thomas Boston
Descrição: In this tract, Thomas Boston challenges the reader with several pointed truths concerning regeneration.




Regeneration is absolutely necessary for you to do anything acceptable to God.


Without generation there is no faith; without faith it is impossible to please God.


If you are not born again, all attempts at reformation are nothing in God’s sight.


Prayers of the unregenerate are an abomination to the Lord.




If this is you, what should you do? According to Boston, you should “fix your thoughts upon Him offered to you in the gospel as fully suited to your case.” That is, Jesus’ death on the cross perfectly satisfied the justice of God, bringing in everlasting righteousness for repentant sinners. He ends with a stark warning, plainly stating that if one is not born again and continues in that state until death, it would have been better had he never been born at all.

 there is room including the fountain of Christ’s blood, the Father’s family, the church, and heaven. Regarding 
when
 there is room, his response is simple: right now there is room. Finally, as to 
why
 there is room, he offers another list which includes the “vast and wide” latitude of God’s decree of election and the infinite value of Christ’s sacrifice. Spurgeon ends with a prayerful request, “May God grant that many shall come to Jesus this very moment, for His dear name’s sake! Amen.”

Título: Young Women and Discretion
Autor: Walter Isenhour
Descrição: Walter Isenhour paints a beautiful picture of what a godly young woman looks like. Not surprisingly, this portrait directly opposes modern views of the roles and behavior of women. Isenhour comments on Titus 2:3-5 which describes older women teaching young women to “love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed.” Throughout this tract, Isenhour expands on the admonition to be discreet, which he defines as “judicious, cautious; wise in conduct and management, especially as to matters of propriety and self-control.” He concludes with two observations: 1) a young woman who lives up to these qualities, lives a life of “nobility, beauty, usefulness and sublimity” and 2) to be a discreet woman “is more to be desired than education, fame, honor, and earthly glory.”

Título: Death of Legal Hope, The
Autor: Abraham Booth
Descrição: The Death of Legal Hope
 is a bold correction to our natural tendency to live as though we were “saved by works.” Even Christians may profess to believe in salvation by faith alone, but perhaps without realizing it they may be leaning on their own morality and good works to earn favor with God. Booth capably shows us from the Scriptures that this cannot be. When one comes to Christ, he dies to any hope of satisfactory law-keeping and enters into the all-sufficient grace of God freely bestowed. His love for Christ then motivates him in evangelical obedience to the moral law as part of his spiritual worship. Only then does he please God and worship acceptably. This message at once both liberates from legal bondage and replaces a false hope and insecurity with blessed confidence in the full and free salvation of our sovereign God.

Descrição: Preparing for Marriage
 presents biblical principles for seeking and preparing for a spouse. You must first seek Christ as Lord and Savior, and then depend upon God to direct to your spouse in His timing. With this foundation, you must seek a spouse actively in God’s way: by much prayer for wisdom, depending upon God, and discerning if a potential spouse is suitable—by assessing reputation, countenance and demeanor, speech, apparel (and the motivations it reveals), companions, education, and counsel of parents. God will grant success if we renounce our own wisdom, practice self-denial, and avoid dependence upon outward appearances. This work is essential for parents and all young people before seeking a spouse.

Descrição: The True Christian’s Love to the Unseen Christ
 is a stirring exhortation to live a life of fervent love for our Savior fueled by the wonder of His love for us. An early edition states about this book, “It everywhere breathes the very spirit of the gospel and, while it unfolds the nature of sincere love to the Lord Jesus, it points the believer to those heavens where sits that Savior, ‘Whom, having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory’ (1Pe 1:8).” The author exalts the beauties of Christ and expounds the believer’s duty and privilege to love such a Savior. It will both support the seeker in coming to Christ and renew the Christian’s genuine love for Christ.

Título: A Wife's Respect
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: We offer the latest issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster: 
A Wife’s Respect. 
Horatius Bonar offers an encouraging look at the creation narratives of Genesis and draws parallels with New Testament authors regarding husband and wife, Christ and church. In a single page, Thomas Vincent enumerates the general responsibilities of a wife, according to the Scripture and the Westminster Shorter Catechism. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones examines a woman’s reverence for her husband and suggests that we should understand it as a “respectful deference.” Then in a detailed discussion, Ezekiel Hopkins gives a very helpful overview of a wife’s role as he describes what a respectful life should look like. Taking this theme even further, John Brown considers a woman’s submission, her pure conduct, and her inward ornaments. This article will take a little work and thought on the reader’s part, but it will richly pay back the investment. George Swinnock discusses a wife’s holiness and her husband’s praise for her, as well as what her submission includes. What happens when a woman’s husband does not obey the Word of truth? John Brown addresses this problem with hope in and help from Christ. Finally, J. R. Miller discusses a wife’s beautiful role in home-making and the reality that a godly husband will always find such a woman lovely in his sight.
 
We pray that the FGB on 
A Husband’s Love 
coupled with 
A Wife’s Respect 
will help Christ’s people everywhere to glimpse something of the beauty of marriage, when it reflects His sacrificial love and headship of His eternally loved Bride, the church. Ponder well the God-appointed roles of husband and wife.

Título: Ascension
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: Do we contemplate, meditate on, and thank God for Christ’s ascension? Christ’s ascension led to His 
continuing
 work for us in heaven. His high priestly intercession and the gift of the Holy Spirit are His great love gifts for His blood-bought people.
 
Therefore, we want to encourage all our readers to consider this most blessed subject with this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster: 
Ascension. 
Charles Spurgeon introduces the subject by recounting the events leading to Christ’s ascension and the stunning beauty of His rising from this world to the glories of heaven. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones explains the unfolding of redemption through the descending and ascending of our blessed Savior. Isaac Ambrose describes 
that
 Christ ascended, as well as 
how
, 
where to
, and 
why
 He ascended, while William Plumer reveals the wonderful works of Christ at God’s right hand. What are some of the benefits of Christ’s heavenly session? John Gill shines Scripture light on this blessed work of our Lord. In a brief article, A. W. Pink surveys Christ’s intercession for the people of God. Part of Christ’s heavenly work at His Father’s right hand is the pouring out of the Holy Spirit: Jonathan Edwards believes that this is the sum and substance of Jesus’ blessings purchased for His people! Why did Jesus Christ ascend? John Flavel answers with six reasons. Then, in a second article from Spurgeon, we learn that Christ’s ascension declares Him victorious in finishing the work of redemption. Finally, Edward Payson asks us several penetrating questions about the Scriptures and Christ’s ascension: do we really believe the testimony of the Word of God about these astounding events?
 
It is our heart’s desire for God’s people to read with great joy the biblical witness of Christ rising into glory, sitting at His Father’s right hand, interceding for His eternally loved people, and sending the Holy Spirit on His great mission. Christ died on Calvary’s cross, rose again from the dead, and ascended into glory for His people. Ascension is a vital and cardinal part of the truth. We pray you will feast on its rich food.

It gives abiding instruction for dealing with practical issues that both officers and members still wrestle with today, including the work of pastors and deacons, duties of the members toward their pastors, reception of new members, church discipline, a member’s moving to another church, and biblical motives for public worship.

Título: Seek the Lord Early
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: It is a good thing to be loved! Children want to be loved by the important people in their lives. But one love is greater than the rest: the love of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, for His people. Oh, how He loves them! He lived for their benefit. He suffered to secure their salvation. He rose again as their eternal King and Savior! Do you know His love? He calls everyone to seek Him and His love. Do you know Him? In this booklet, J. C. Ryle urges children to understand and believe the love of Christ, and to seek a living relationship with Him.

Título: Meditation
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: To encourage God’s people, we present this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster on Meditation. Meditation is essential for a healthy walk with Christ and growth in grace. Charles Spurgeon introduces this subject with a helpful overview of the importance, practice, and benefits of biblical meditation. Thomas Watson defines what it is. Thomas Manton is convinced meditation is a biblical duty, and he tells us why. What is the nature of meditation? Isaac Ambrose answers that and describes the time, place, and matter of that holy practice. William Bates beautifully instructs us in occasional meditation, focusing on God’s creation, and George Swinnock offers five descriptions of solemn and set meditation on sacred subjects. Are there real dangers in neglecting this holy act of deep thinking? Edmund Calamy lists twelve! And they are sobering. John Owen, a deeply spiritually-minded pastor and theologian, presents us with practical helps for meditating upon God, and then A. W. Pink meticulously shows us how to approach a biblical text so that we can chew the Bread of Life. Are you new to meditation and wonder what to meditate about? In a second article, Thomas Watson gives a beautiful panorama of biblical themes to fix our hearts on, starting with God in eternity, progressing to Christ in history, and extending to heaven and hell. Then, Jonathan Edwards urges us to show our love to Christ; he does so by giving us a wonderful description of His loveliness. Spurgeon, a great advocate and practitioner of meditation, closes this issue by instructing us with sweet meditations of Jesus Christ our Lord. And how precious they are! Be forewarned: meditation is hard in our too-busy, distracted world; but this FGB is a brief “how-to” that we pray will fan the flames of your heart to seek the glory of Christ in Scripture and to love Him as never before.

Título: Mortification of Sin
Autor: John Owen
Descrição: Mortification of Sin
 is the classic work by John Owen that challenges every believer to apply biblical truth to purify themselves through mortification. To do so, the Christian must learn to recognize the activity and deception of indwelling sin. He must lean upon the Holy Spirit to accomplish the work of mortification. His whole life and comfort in Christ depends on his engaging in this work daily and continually. In two excellent chapters, Owen explains common misconceptions about mortification, and what it actually is. Mortification requires both faith and whole-hearted diligence. The believer is warned about his danger when he allows himself to entertain even small habitual sins. Then Owen challenges the reader to enter the fight at the first sign of sin, to lean upon Christ and the perfect work of the Holy Spirit. “You must be always killing sin, or it will be killing you!”

Título: Adoption
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In this issue of the 
Free Grace Broadcaster 
on adoption,  Robert Alexander Webb introduces us to the importance of this vital doctrine, giving us three reasons why it is so important. Charles Spurgeon declares that God’s act of predestinating sinners to the adoption of children is an act of pure grace. What are the causes of adoption? John Gill answers by demonstrating the gracious work of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as the cause of that miracle of grace. John Murray describes the Fatherhood of God biblically, distinguishing it from the false notion that all people are the children of God. He also explains that adoption is neither justification nor regeneration, while being intimately connected to both. Abraham Booth tells us that God’s grace reigns in adoption and offers clear biblical ways that believers are united to God and made part of His heavenly family. What is the nature of adoption? And what are its benefits? Do you know? David Martyn Lloyd-Jones explains both with biblical clarity and the force of truth. Scottish theologian and minister John Dick sharply contrasts the satanic family of which believers were once a part with the glory and splendor of being in God’s righteous family. How does one know if he or she is indeed a child of God? Octavius Winslow beautifully explains the witness of God’s Spirit in our souls that we know that we 
are
 the children of God. Then, with clarity and moving imagery, John Eadie makes a valiant attempt to tell us what it means when the apostle John says, “We shall be like him”—like Christ Jesus! And finally, Thomas Reade helps us to consider the sacred evidence of sonship. He, like Winslow, wants to help us answer the question, “Am I a child of God?” No regenerate soul can read these thoughts without being moved and without desiring to finish his course to the glory of Christ Who saved us.

Título: Preserving the Honor of Marriage: Biblical Guidance from the Puritans
Autor: Joel Beeke
Descrição: Preserving the Honor of Marriage
 explores the biblical command for marriage, “submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God” (Eph 5:21). It is needed in our day when, in many cases, submission in marriage has become either oppressive or irrelevant. 
But to honor our spouse is to honor the God of marriage and the covenant of marriage. Fulfilling our God-assigned roles is a matter of faithfulness to God. Two principles underlie mutual submission: Christ and His Church, and the marriage covenant. The love of Christ for His Church and the Church’s joyfully following Christ are the foundations for biblical submission. Submission is Christ-honoring when we see it as a vital part of covenantal commitment. This booklet is important for those who are married and those preparing for marriage.

Título: Regulative Principle of the Church
Autor: Sam Waldron
Descrição: Does God expect us to worship Him in a particular way? Is there a blueprint for the church? Sam Waldron gives a distinct affirmative while he brings these related questions together in an insightful discussion of the regulative principle. God calls His church to worship Him according to His commands and the apostolic example, not our good ideas. The history, biblical context, function, and limitations of the regulative principle are discussed in detail. While God’s people throughout history have often seen the regulative principle as focused on worship, this study demonstrates that a more biblical approach will also emphasize that the church, its organization, and its functions should be carefully regulated by Scripture as well.

Título: Holiness
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: In Holiness (1879), J. C. Ryle shows that God’s people grow in holiness when they believe and obey the Scriptures in daily life. He explains the meaning of biblical “perfection,” the controversial seventh chapter of Romans, the doctrine of the indwelling Christ, the relationship of consecration to conversion, and the necessity for those who would be holy to “watch, pray, and fight.” Like the great Puritan masters from whom he freely draws, he offers no easy way to the highest Christian life. His desire throughout is practical and persistent—that personal holiness may increase greatly among God’s people.

Título: Radical Depravity
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: Jesus Christ saves radically depraved men, women, and children from their sins. However, to understand, believe, and love the good news about the crucified and resurrected Savior, we must first understand our condition. Thus, we offer this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster: Radical Depravity. Arthur Pink introduces us to this weighty subject by asking the question, “Is man a totally and thoroughly depraved creature by nature?” Thomas Reade then tells us about the deadly consequences and bitter fruits of Adam’s fall: in Adam all die. We then consider Joel Beeke’s helpful survey of the doctrine of human depravity. A second article by Thomas Reade leads us to a painful truth: the heart of man is evil. But he does not leave us there: he takes us to the blessed Son of God for deliverance. John Owen describes with great clarity the depraved and corrupted state of man’s mind and teaches us that the only remedy for this great darkness is the new birth: “You must be born again.” Loraine Boettner explains the extent and effects of original sin, which results in human inability in the matters of salvation. What is our true spiritual condition outside of Christ? Charles Spurgeon declares that we are legally, spiritually, and eternally dead. Nevertheless, he also tells us that we can be legally, spiritually, eternally alive by faith in Jesus Christ the Son! We then hear from John Flavel that in mercy, grace, and love, God draws sinners to Jesus Christ, gradually, suitably, powerfully, effectually, and finally. That is indeed good news! J. C. Ryle brings our subject to a close by asking a penetrating question: “Are you dead or alive?” Each of us, dear readers, must answer that question.

Título: Mountains of Brass: The Decrees of God
Autor: Hercules Collins
Descrição: Mountains of Brass
 examines the biblical doctrine of the sovereign decrees of God to show that they are good, trustworthy, unchangeable, monumental in scope, and everlasting—indeed, like mountains made of solid brass. The author approaches his subject using Ephesians 1:11 as the text: God “worketh all things after the counsel of his own will.” Today’s reader will benefit from the biblical explanation of many of God’s attributes as properties of His divine will, what this doctrine tells us about God, and how it is used of God to bring wisdom, pleasure, and contentment to our lives.

Título: John Ploughman's Pictures
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: John Ploughman’s Pictures
 is a classic from the pen of a very wise pastor—one who had his roots in the English farm country. Spurgeon always desired to speak to the common man in terms he could understand. In this sequel to 
John Ploughman’s Talk
, the author again rolls back eloquence in order to use common everyday word pictures to convey practical biblical wisdom. As such, this volume is especially useful to all Christians in their quest to apply the Scriptures to grow in godliness. Children of all ages during family worship will relate to its common examples. Topics include the use of money, judging others, pride and boasting, anger, responsibility and priorities, hard work, parenting, caution, deceit, providence, self-control, and stewardship.

Título: Communion with God
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: We cannot imagine that we know God, if we do not have communion with Him. Puritan Matthew Barker defines that holy communion for us as one who walked in experiential Christianity. Charles Spurgeon then argues that the new birth establishes a principle of life from which communion with God springs in all regenerate souls. What is the nature of this communion? Benjamin Keach gives us a wonderful overview with heart moving, biblical thoughts. In the first of three articles, John Owen introduces us to communion with the Father. Matthew Barker offers another article by helping us to obtain and maintain that holy communication with our Savior and Lord. Owen then gives a wonderful glimpse at what communion with Christ looks like, sprinkling his text with the Song of Solomon. Can we honestly say that we hunger and thirst, even yearn and long for God’s presence and fellowship? Thomas Brooks beautifully lays out what the regenerate soul seeks after. In his last article, Owen gives a very brief look at communion with the Holy Spirit—a practice that is probably rare for many. John Flavel fills our hearts and souls with the loveliness of the heavenly privilege that we have in communion with God. And Thomas Brooks brings this issue to a close by calling us to keep our communion with God alive and healthy as a sound defense against Satan’s snares.

Título: Anger
Autor: Max Doner
Descrição: Anger! is a problem in every human life, and can be an acute sin for Christians. In this concise but complete analysis, we see both righteous and sinful anger explained. All Christians must know the difference: we must cultivate the one biblically, and mortify the other in order to avoid sinning against our holy God. The cause of sinful anger is carefully diagnosed: pride in rebelling against God’s rule in our lives—as revealed in His daily providences that block our expectations. The text spotlights step-by-step biblical solutions, leading to a true, trustworthy, and lasting victory that does not mask the symptoms, but destroys sinful anger at its root. The reader can look forward to hope, greater faith, and a more consistent walk with the Lord Jesus Christ.

Descrição: A Believer’s Last Day
 was originally preached as a funeral sermon. In his unique descriptive style, filled with illustrations from Scripture and antiquity, Brooks encourages all to consider death. His call to unbelievers is that they would repent while still in this day of grace and flee to Christ for salvation. His encouragement for believers everywhere is that they would realize that death is not their enemy, but a friend to escort them into the untold wonders of God’s presence. There we shall enter into not only a blessed place, but holy company, worshipful service, and spiritual rest. Thus we can look forward to our dying day as our best day ever lived.

Título: Spiritual Mindedness
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: We who profess to be the blood-bought people of God really must answer the question, “Am I spiritually minded?” To help us answer biblically, Charles Simeon introduces us to the subject of carnal minds and spiritual minds. John Owen then explains what spiritual mindedness is. D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones gives us a powerful exposition of what a carnal mind is, and why it is death. Another question, which is foundational to this subject, is, “Do you have God’s Spirit?” J. C. Ryle answers that question, listing what the Holy Spirit produces in the life of believers, which includes making them spiritually minded. It is true that spiritually minded people have carnal thoughts, and carnally minded people have spiritual thoughts. But spiritually minded people long to be free from carnal thinking, and Jeremiah Burroughs arms us for that battle. What then is the evidence of a spiritual mind? John Owen speaks directly to that question in his second article. And then Jeremiah Burroughs guides us with sound biblical principles for cultivating a spiritual mind. This FGB closes with three articles that give God’s children important things to think about: Thomas Manton urges us to think about death. Samuel Davies points out the folly of not contemplating life in this world in the awesome light of eternity, for every one of us will spend eternity in hell or in the glories of Christ’s holy presence and everlasting joy. Finally, Thomas Reade lifts our eyes of faith and fastens them on heavenly joys. Can you imagine anything better to meditate on than the attributes of the Triune God Who saves us; the Prophet, Priest, and King Who has done everything infinitely necessary to redeem and preserve us for His glorious kingdom; and the Holy Spirit Who births us into that kingdom and empowers us for our journey to the Celestial City? Friend, do you love God with your mind? Think about it.

 is John Owen’s biblical warning to Christians for avoiding the many significant harms of temptation. It is the second of his three books dealing with sin: 
Mortification of Sin
, 
Temptation
, and 
Indwelling Sin
. In 
Temptation
, Owen presents one of the most thorough treatments of our part in sanctification (“Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation,” Mat 26:41) and Christ’s part (“I will keep thee from the hour of temptation,” Rev 3:10). Owen shows successively what temptation is, what it is to “enter into temptation,” the power of temptation, marks of having fallen into temptation, the role of prayer, how we must “watch,” what it is to “keep the word of Christ’s patience,” and motives for watching against temptation.

Descrição: For the good of our immortal souls, we offer the latest FGB, 
Self-examination
. Puritan Thomas Watson helpfully introduces the subject to us. Charles Spurgeon then exhorts us to examine ourselves and gives a useful analysis of the word examine. Wilhemus à Brakel urges us to go even further and examine our faith. With great wisdom and insight, J. C. Ryle warns about his (and our) age of spiritual danger. Arthur Pink shows us that the Scriptures call us to this holy exercise, and Octavius Winslow asks us to dig deep, as we answer his question, “Are you alive or dead?” The Lord’s Supper is always a crucial time to examine our hearts, and Jonathan Edwards helps us to understand who should come to the Table and who should not. Thomas Wilcox gives us some penetrating questions by which we may examine our profession of Christ, and Charles Spurgeon asks yet another pointed question: “Does Christ dwell in you?” Finally, Ryle closes with brief but powerful applications of where to begin and how to proceed with self-examination. Hear those men: they are skilled physicians of the soul.

Título: Redeem the Time
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: As we begin the new year, we offer you the latest issue of the FGB, 
Redeem the Time
. Octavius Winslow introduces this crucial subject, proclaiming time a solemn, priceless gift. Jonathan Edwards wholeheartedly agrees and reminds us that eternal happiness or misery depends on how we use time. A. A. Hodge then briefly offers definitions of God, time, and eternity. Do we think of time as opportunity? Richard Baxter says yes, we should, and gives numerous reasons to support his answer. Following that, David Martyn Lloyd-Jones calls us to heed Paul’s exhortation to buy up opportunities to serve the Lord Jesus. Baxter, again, is not likely to win many friends among modern Christians as he strongly exposes time thieves that rob us of our precious gift; but you should read him carefully, pray earnestly, and examine your heart by Scripture before you write him off. Lloyd-Jones urges us to recognize the true differences between believers and the lost world, arguing that the way believers use their time should be a witness to the lost. Charles Spurgeon asserts and affirms from Scripture that our time is limited and short: how we use every second matters. Jeremiah Burroughs makes alarmingly clear that our abuse of time may lead to our most dreadful loss—the loss of our never-dying souls for eternity. Finally, Spurgeon declares the good news that Jesus Christ died on Calvary’s cross and rose again to save sinners. But you must believe that astonishing good news now, now, now! So, what time is it, friend? It is time to repent, believe, and be saved; or it is time to serve the Lord Who loved and gave Himself for us. You may not have another day for either. We urge you: make the time to meditate on this vital subject—the last grains of your hourglass are running towards eternity. 
Now
 is the time.

Título: Does God Use Sickness?
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: Sickness is everywhere and reaches everyone in this sinful world. We all experience its annoying, debilitating, and even deadly force. Can something so painful as sickness be good? J. C. Ryle says yes! In God's providence in this world, sickness is good, because it reminds men of death, makes them think of God, softens their hearts, humbles us before God, and tests our professions of faith. Since sickness comes from the wise and good hand of God even into such a sinful world as ours we should respond to sickness by preparing to meet God, bearing patiently the sickness that comes to us, and helping our fellow men in it. What will 
you
 do when you fall ill? Will you gripe and grumble? Or will you seek soul-solace, as well as physical healing, from the Great Physician of souls? Christ is the great Lord, Savior, and Healer. Cleave to Him through your times of sickness.

Título: Does God Heal Today? 
Autor: Arthur W. Pink
Descrição: Is divine healing scriptural or unscriptural? The Lord is “a very present help in trouble” (Psa 46:1)—does this mean nothing more than that the saint must seek grace from Him to patiently endure afflictions? The Scriptures have much to say concerning the body and its healing.
 
It is clear that many Christians are living below their privileges in this matter. Jehovah-Rophi (“the LORD that healeth thee,” Exo 15:26) is as truly one of His titles as Jehovah-Tsidkenu (“the LORD our righteousness,” Jer 23:6).
 
The Lord graciously gives many promises and much instruction for his people who are seeking healing. But the Lord's promises for healing are not a definite expectation that God will heal every specific disease, but a peaceful assurance that He will do that which is most for His glory and the sick one’s good. Faith is reliance and submission as well as expectation.

Lastly, realizing that Paul considered himself as “chief” of all sinners brings us to deal realistically with our own sin.

Título: Introduction to the Puritans (Memorial Edition)
Autor: Erroll Hulse
Descrição: Introduction to the Puritans
 is a wonderful overview of the Puritan movement in the 1600s that has given the English-speaking world its richest depository of theological writings, with practical applications in every area of life. Part One helps us to understand the fascinating history as the British monarchy took some unpredictable turns and various factions literally fought for control of Britain’s religious life. Part Two ably illucidates the lives of the Puritans with brief summaries of 20+ Puritan leaders. These were real men whose contributions came at great personal cost to themselves and their families. Part Three shows us the importance of the Puritan legacy as it applies to important doctrinal and practical issues of our day. All Christians will benefit from knowing the Puritans. This book affords an excellent place to start.
 
This book is a Memorial Edition which includes sections on the life and ministry of the author, Erroll Hulse, who was a pastor in the United Kingdom and exercised a far-reaching ministry through the 
Reformation Today
 magazine, and through the African Pastors' Conferences, both of which are still in operation today.

Título: Indwelling Sin
Autor: John Owen
Descrição: Indwelling Sin
 ranks high among Owen’s works, with rare insight into the experience of the Christian soul. The basis of the treatise is taken from Romans 7:21, where indwelling sin in believers is in the character of “a law,” whose seat is the heart and whose nature is enmity against God. Sin acts consecutively in withdrawing the mind from what is good, through positive opposition to God, by ensnaring the soul in captivity, and lastly by filling it with hatred to the principles of holiness. The power of indwelling sin is seen in its deceitfulness, developed in three stages using James 1:14-15: the mind is withdrawn from obedience; the affections are enticed; and actual sin is then committed. Its power in the believer’s soul is seen further by observing its effect in unregenerate persons, its resistance to moral law, and our fruitless attempts to subdue it in our own strength. Owen’s goal is that we become vigilantly watchful in consistently opposing sin and successful in waging war with sin through applying the sin-conquering truths of Christ’s gospel. Many consider this book (together with his 
Mortification of Sin
 and 
Temptation
) essential for Christians of all ages who desire to walk with the Lord in true biblical holiness.

Título: Sickness
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In this edition of the Broadcaster, entitled "Sickness," J. C. Ryle introduces this important subject by declaring that sickness is universal, and he explains why that is so. Arthur W. Pink then describes the gift of health as priceless. Philip B. Power tells us how to apply God’s wonderful comforts in Christ to our sickbed. Do you use your time wisely while you are sick? Thomas Boston gives biblical reasons for how and why you should. A living author, Christopher Bogosh, has written an excellent book—Compassionate Jesus—calling Christians to rethink our approach to modern medicine. He tells us how to use God’s medicine—prayer. In a truly provocative article, John D. Wells reveals why the sickbed is not favorable for finding eternal life. Following that, Puritan George Swinnock reminds us of our biblical duty to visit and minister to the sick: it is not merely a pastoral work but an act that Christ will mention in the Day of Judgment! In a second article, Ryle asks hard questions and presses our consciences with biblical duties to help us prepare ourselves to honor Christ, examine ourselves before Christ, and commune with Christ in our times of sickness! Lastly, in my opinion, no uninspired writer brings the sweetness of Christ to the subject of sickness as beautifully as Charles Spurgeon. And he exhorts us, “If Jesus loves you, and you are sick, let all the world see how you glorify God in your sickness. Let friends and nurses see how the beloved of the Lord are cheered and comforted by Him.” Do we believe that? God does use sickness for the good of the lost and His people for His glory.

Descrição: Evangelical Compromise
 reviews the ecumenical documents “Evangelicals and Catholics Together” (signed by prominent evangelical and Catholic leaders in 1994) and “The Gift of Salvation” (a joint statement produced in 1997). This booklet presents an important case study regarding cooperative efforts of evangelism and moral influence in society. When do such well-intentioned efforts go astray? What doctrines may be ignored in such efforts? And which ones must be maintained, even to the point of separation from such cooperation? This will help readers discern situations when “doctrine divides” for valid scriptural reasons, and that “love” must never lead to a compromise of biblical truth. When evangelicals and Catholics use the terms grace and justification, they do not mean the same thing at all!

Descrição: The Ordinance of Baptism
 is a concise yet thorough biblical examination of Christian baptism: how it was ordained by God, its Old Testament precedents, and most importantly, who are to be its subjects. Gill carefully examines the New Testament incidents of baptism to determine if the subjects are repentant believers in the atoning sacrifice of Christ, or infant covenant children of believers. This thread continues through the remainder of the treatise as Gill considers baptism’s manner of administration (immersion or sprinkling), form (in the names of the Trinity), and purposes and uses. The latter brings encouragement to every believer as we anticipate obedient fellowship with our Lord among His people.

Título: Only One Way
Autor: John C. Ryle
Descrição: Is there more than one road to heaven? As Peter declared in Acts 4:12, the biblical answer is a clear “No!” There is only one way! And that way of salvation is through believing the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Lord Jesus Christ.
 
In 
Only One Way
, J.C. Ryle explores why there can only be one way of salvation. Who we are, Who God is, and what God’s book, the Bible, is, all demand that we conclude that there can be no other way. He calls us to consider, “If there is only one way, do you live like you believe it?” Are you resting all your hope in Jesus Christ’s work? Are you fervently seeking to bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to those around you who are lost?  With surprising pertinence to our own generation, he gives an urgent wakeup call to deny the “charitable idol” of liberality that acts like all religions are right and avoids stepping on others’ religious toes. For the good of our own souls and the eternal well-being of those around us, let us be clear: There is only one way!

Descrição: "What we say is capable of eternally affecting those who hear us, and therefore the Bible ranks our words with our works." In this small tract, Arthur W. Pink shows the necessity of having our speech seasoned with salt. Our tongues can be used for evil or for good. The words we speak are a sure index of our character. Read this to be convicted and to be stirred up to more godliness in the vital area of the tongue!

Título: Death and Dying
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: With hundreds of thousands of deaths in the wake of our worldwide pandemic, the shadow of the King of Terrors haunts the minds of people everywhere in the world. So, let us think about, talk about, pray about death. To urge you in that direction, we present the latest issue of the FGB: 
Death and Dying
. Christopher Bogosh introduces the subject by describing the three deaths found in Scripture: physical, spiritual, and eternal. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones tells us that, contrary to the modern view, the Bible clearly teaches that death is not the cessation of existence and that the human soul is immortal. Charles Spurgeon explains that death is our enemy, which entered human experience by sin; but Jesus Christ has conquered it! Christopher Bogosh then challenges the modern idea of brain death and gives us instead the testimony of God’s Word about death. Robert M’Cheyne tells us that the world fears death and what follows it; but our heavenly Father and the Holy Spirit declare, “Blessed are the dead.”  Do you think about death? Have you ever meditated on death? Thomas Boston explains meditation step-by-step and then gives a wonderful example of a meditation on death. Now, what if you died in your sins this year? Have you considered what you would lose in this world and in the world to come? Samuel Davies presses us to consider our eternal loss if we die in our sins. For many, preparing for death means a will and an insurance policy. But a third provocative and helpful article by Christopher Bogosh teaches us how to pray to prepare for death—praying for clear evidence of salvation, for renewing the inner man, and for being equipped by God to face death without fear. Christians are never surprised to learn that unbelievers fear death and are unwilling to die. But the same should not be said of believers! To our surprise, many believers seem to be unwilling to die. Thomas Brooks applies the Scriptures to move us, not only to be willing to die, but to heartily desire it! Last of all, death is a part, a terrible part, of God’s curse upon sin. Nevertheless, Octavius Winslow paints the preciousness of the believer’s death with such glorious strokes that our hearts are swept into breathtaking, majestic scenes of God’s love for us, God’s desire for us, God’s joy in us, and Christ’s triumph for us! Read prayerfully, it should make you pant for death and eternity with the resurrected Lord of glory! I am going to die. So are you. And our inescapable appointment is one day closer. But the King of kings has conquered the King of Terrors: Let us die well, trusting Christ.

In this introduction to the doctrine, you will learn how adoption takes us out of the courtroom where we have marvelously been justified by grace through faith into the Father’s house itself! In our Savior Jesus Christ, we are made God’s children, part of His family.  And we enjoy all the privileges and care that come with being a part of such a wonderful home!

And when the Lord Jesus Christ will return in glory to this world, all the dead will be raised again, to stand before Him in judgment. Eternal happiness with God or eternal sorrow under His judgment will follow. Are you ready? Do you think about your place in eternity?

Título: Heaven
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster, entitled: “Heaven,” J. C. Ryle introduces us to the subject of heaven with a brief account of that divine region from the lips of Christ Himself. Edward Donnelly beautifully describes heaven itself as the place of God’s glory. Paul Helm shows us that, based on Scripture alone, heaven is redemptive, fixed, and final. Few people have ever had the great gift of describing the things of Christ with such beauty as did Charles Spurgeon. His vision of the Beatific Vision and the glory of seeing Christ should stoke the longing soul with living hope. Heaven, that place of God’s glory, is a world of love, says Jonathan Edwards—a place where we will, in love, all be filled with the fullness of God. Thomas Brooks picks up where Spurgeon leaves off, expanding on the glory of our experience with God the Father and Christ the Son: the best and choicest presence of God and Christ is reserved in heaven! Thomas Reade enriches our hearts with meditations on heaven. Meditate here, friend, and set your hearts on fire with the hope that lies before us. What is your vision of heaven? Is it robes, harps, and sitting on clouds forever? Derek Thomas paints a challenging biblical picture of the new heaven and the new earth. Edwards, in a second article, tells us how to seek that blessed world of love and how to avoid hell, the world of hatred. And last, we complete our journey to the Celestial City with a portion from John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress.

Título: Ten Commandments and the Christian, The
Autor: Richard Barcellos
Descrição: The Ten Commandments and the Christian is an important and very relevant topic. Is the believer in Christ to obey laws revealed in the Bible prior to the giving of the New Testament? Specifically, is he to obey the Ten Commandments? If so, on what basis? The lawless condition of both the professing church of Christ and the world that surrounds it demands that we find biblical answers to these questions. This booklet explores the significance of the Ten Commandments through their place in the Old Covenant and New Covenant,  through their function as reflecting the moral law, and through their treatment in the London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689.

Título: Election & Reprobation
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In this issue of the FGB, 
Election and Reprobation
, Robert Purnell gives a concise introduction to God’s decree of election. Arthur Pink then argues that election is a foundational doctrine upon which many other doctrines rest. J. C. Ryle states the doctrine of election succinctly and beautifully. In a second article, Pink directs us to where election begins—in the eternal purpose and will of almighty God. In harmony with Pink, Wilhelmus à Brakel gives us a helpful glimpse of the decrees of God. In a third article, Pink displays the glory and beauty of Jesus as the first elect of God and as the Holy One in Whom all others are chosen. Joel Beeke and Paul Smalley then give us an extended biblical explanation of election. Then, in a second article, Robert Purnell once again gives us a concise overview of reprobation. Following that, Lorraine Boettner unfolds the solemn biblical account of reprobation. How do election and evangelism work together. Southern Baptist Robert Selph explains this clearly and briefly—it is not as complicated as many make it. But how does one know if God has chosen him or her to everlasting life? Thomas Reade answers with verve, beauty, and encouragement. Lastly, Octavius Winslow shows us the glorious truth that all God’s people were chosen to be like Christ Jesus, our lovely and blessed Savior. What a glorious, encouraging, and thrilling thought! Whatever you think of these two doctrines, we pray that you will ponder them prayerfully and see the immensity of God’s amazing grace in Christ. “Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God” (Rom 11:22).

Título: Christ's Love for the Sick
Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon
Descrição: Formerly titled 
Beloved, Yet Afflicted
 
Just as Jesus allowed Lazarus to sicken and die to show His own glory by raising him from the dead, so our Lord often takes His own people through times of suffering to show them more of His own gracious care. This sermon by Spurgeon assures the believer that though God's children are often afflicted, they are as surely beloved. Even death is merely God's calling his loved ones home to Himself. 
 
This message was preached before an audience of invalid ladies at Mentone, France, in 1880. It is taken from 
The Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit
, Vol. 26, #1518.

Descrição: The Divine Covenants
 is a careful expository study of the covenants in Scripture: Everlasting, Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Siniatic, Davidic, and Messianic (the New Covenant). Through discussions of Scripture texts, patterns (such as types, promises, and fulfilment),  and doctrines (such as law and gospel distinctions),   the reader will come to appreciate the importance of the Old Testament covenants in leading up to Christ’s New Covenant. Christ rules and reigns today as the Prophet, Priest, and King of His people—who joyfully follow Him in the New Covenant in obedience to His will, in gratitude for so great a salvation He has freely bestowed upon them.

Título: Providence
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster, you will discover the God Who is God—the God Who reigns over every atom in His spectacular universe. Benjamin Beddome introduces us to our Sovereign by showing how His great works of creation and providence are related. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones defines providence by examining its three elements—preservation, government, and concurrence. Then, Arthur W. Pink explains the meaning of the Godhood of God and why it is crucial for Christians to understand it in opposition to the dignity, power, and attainments of man. But what is providence like and from what does it arise, properly understood? William S. Plumer tells us that God’s providence is like God’s nature—holy, just, benevolent, wise, sovereign, stable, and irresistible! Pink then explains so beautifully that God rules everything—all inanimate matter, irrational creatures, human beings, and all angels, good and evil. How can such a lofty doctrine be practical to believers? Joel Beeke gives us sound answers from the infallible Scriptures and from the Puritans. To compliment those answers, Thomas Watson gives biblical instruction in the ways that our sovereign God works all things for good to His eternally loved people. There is one aspect of providence that especially thrills the heart of all believers: how God worked in His sovereign, powerful, and mysterious ways to bring them to saving faith in Christ and to everlasting life! John Flavel reminds us of that astonishing work and the surprising mercies of God’s grace! Lastly, Thomas Reade concludes our subject by filling our souls with a glorious vision of God’s absolute reign by Christ Jesus in our hearts.

As in Ryle’s day, “There is a widely-spread desire to make things pleasant in religion—to saw off the corners and edges of the cross, and to avoid, as far as possible, self-denial.” Ryle reminds us of the danger of friendship with the world. He shows what true separation is not, and then what it does consist of. Finally, we learn that the secret of real victory over the world is the Christian’s heart renewed by the Holy Spirit, manifest in a living faith and bold confession of Christ.

It “uses the truth of Scripture to shine the glory of God into the depths of the soul to call people to live solely and wholly for God.” Discriminating and balanced, biblical preaching cultivates communion with God and feeds the soul. Beeke draws from various Reformed preachers of the past to show the multidimensional richness of Reformed experiential preaching. This is an excerpt from the larger book titled

Título: Temptation

Descrição: Temptation is a profoundly serious matter. Believers must realize that it always sets before us a choice between God’s Word and the serpent’s word. John Owen introduces us to the subject, explaining the evil of temptation, how it prevails, and the way to prevent it. Matthew Henry comments with great clarity on the serpent, the first woman, and the first temptation. J. C. Ryle tells us about our great Savior Jesus Christ and how He was tempted by the devil. Thomas Manton gives us much light on how the devil tempts. Does God have a design in temptation? John Newton knows that He does and biblically explains it to us. One of the problems Christians face is determining what leads us to sin; Jonathan Edwards instructs us in that vital skill. William Gurnall urges us to watchfulness because our enemy is ever awake and prowling. Thomas Brooks offers us a wonderful catalogue of helps against temptation, and then Charles Spurgeon encourages our souls with the great news that Christ Jesus has the power to help us in our seasons of temptation. To help us think clearly about this subject, Octavius Winslow gives us lessons from Christ’s temptations. Finally, Charles Spurgeon pours gospel balm into our wounded consciences by preaching forgiveness for the tempted and sometimes falling child of God.

Título: Church & State
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: The purpose of this FGB is to provoke you to think biblically about the subject of the church and state. You will hear from Lutherans, Presbyterians, and Particular (Reformed) Baptists—all of them struggling to answer church/state questions from the Word of God. We begin with Chapter 24 of the 1677/89 Second London Baptist Confession: “Of the Civil Magistrate.” Jean-Marc Berthoud explains two types of power: the magistrate and the church. John Calvin declares that God has ordained civil magistrates for humanity’s good. Pierre Viret discusses the three major forms of government: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy—which is best? R. C. Sproul explains that the essence of civil government is force. Is government authority absolute? H. Rondel Rumburg argues that it is delegated, not absolute power. He also discusses the Social Contract Theory. Christopher Goodman examines true obedience when facing civil or religious oppression. The important doctrine of the Lesser Magistrates has been forgotten by modern believers as well as unbelievers; but Matthew Trewhella teaches us its biblical importance. Building upon that doctrine, which the Reformers and Puritans held, we have extraordinary examples of it in the Magdeburg Confession, John Knox, and Isaac Backus—Lutherans, a Presbyterian Reformer, and a Baptist! Finally, Samuel Davies tells us about the greatest King—Jesus Christ; and he takes us by the hand to show us the glories of Jesus’ kingdom. Jesus rules over all the kings and kingdoms of men. He alone is King of kings and Lord of lords!

Descrição: What makes prayer, prayer? This enriching ordinance of God brings the believer into great familiarity with God, opens God’s heart to us, and fills our empty souls. Prayer obtains great things from God and is the very friendship of the soul with God.  But what is the heart of prayer? Is there an essence to prayer without which “all your lifting up, both of hands, and eyes, and voices, will be to no purpose at all”? Yes. And the God who hears prayer has left us plain instruction about the living essence, the beating heart, of prayer. John Bunyan finds the key in the Apostle Paul’s words: “I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.” He begins with a memorable definition of prayer. Then he explores the two great aspects of the heart of prayer: prayer with the Spirit, and prayer with the understanding. May this sermon in booklet form bear the fruit of Spirit-empowered prayer for God’s glory and the joy of God’s people everywhere.

Título: Christ in the Old Testament
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: This new issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster is “Christ in the Old Testament.” J. C. Ryle opens this profound subject by explaining that the key to Bible knowledge is Jesus Christ. The articles that follow use Christ’s three-fold division of the OT: law, psalms, and prophets. Charles Spurgeon preaches the “first gospel” from the Law in Genesis 3:15, the gospel of the serpent’s doom! Likewise, George Whitefield reveals Christ to us in the account of Abraham’s obedient attempt to sacrifice Isaac. Christ’s sufferings were prophesied throughout the OT, and Jonathan Edwards shows us that in detail. William Plumer explains that we might see Christ where He is not and miss where He is in the Psalms if we interpret Scripture poorly. John Calvin then interprets Psalm 2 well to show us that Christ is the Son of God declared there. Matthew Henry takes us to Christ in the Prophets, beautifully mining Christ from the gold of Isaiah.  Charles Simeon also shows from Isaiah that God the Father called and commissioned Christ as His anointed preacher. Is the gospel really in the OT? The law, the psalms, and the prophets overflow with it: James Durham proclaims Christ and His gospel from Isaiah; George Whitefield turns to Jeremiah to draw our hearts to Christ our righteousness; and Richard Sibbes takes the majestic text of Malachi that shines with the glory of Christ the Sun of Righteousness. We close with Charles Spurgeon telling us that on the road to Emmaus, Jesus was the best of tutors, teaching  from the best of books, and explaining the best of subjects—His own Person and work.

Título: The Spirit and the Christ
Autor: Hensworth Jonas
Descrição: The Spirit and the Christ
 calls the Christian to bid goodbye to formal, self-motivated mediocrity posing as religion. Instead, embrace living by the power of the Holy Spirit—our Lord Jesus’ legacy to His disciples in John 16. In light of His imminent return to heaven, Christ unveiled the most amazing partnership: the Spirit and the Christ. By His Holy Spirit, He exercises a partnership of astonishing power to give life, strength, and holiness to His people. He exercises a partnership of persuasion to instruct and guide His people in the truth. And He exercises a partnership of praise to point our idol-ridden lives to Christ the perfect Savior as the true object of all our love, joy, hope, and praise. Are you basking in the power, truth, and Christ-centeredness of  this glorious partnership—the Spirit and the Christ?

Título: Thoughts on Public Prayer
Autor: John Newton
Descrição: In this little booklet, John Newton addresses the subject of public prayer. He warns of the dangers of excessive length, preaching in prayer, formal praying, unwarranted repetition, and extremes in voice and manner. He says, "I shall be glad if these hints may be of any service to those who desire to worship God in spirit and in truth, and who wish that whatever has a tendency to dampen the spirit of devotion, either in themselves or in others, might be avoided" (from the Conclusion).

Título: Conscience
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: This 
Free Grace Broadcaster
 is dedicated to the subject of the conscience. Arthur Pink introduces this vital subject by defining conscience and by describing it as our best friend or worst enemy. Richard Sibbes beautifully explains the nature of conscience and why God gave it to us. William Perkins helpfully lists the duties of conscience as giving testimony and judgment. Following that, William Fenner demonstrates that every person has a conscience and gives further reasons why God gave it to us. In a second article, Arthur Pink helps us understand that our conscience has been corrupted by sin, that it is only able to work according to the light that it has, and that its operations are faulty. John Flavel takes us deeply into the sin-burdened conscience, and what a journey that is! He writes of the burdensome sense of sin, the memories of our sin, and the condemnation of conscience. In his second article, William Fenner informs us that ministers must know the spiritual state of their flocks to properly minister the Word to the conscience of God’s people. Again, John Flavel reveals the misery of a conscience in hell—a damned conscience. Yes, friends, consciences will follow the lost to hell. Mercifully, in his third article, Pink takes us into the comforting realm of a good conscience: how do we obtain one, what are its characteristics, and how do we maintain it? J. C. Ryle than tells us that nothing in our gospel-war against sin is better calculated to quiet, soothe, and comfort a raging conscience than justification by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. Finally, Charles Spurgeon warns against using outward practices and a little bit of religion to quiet our conscience: that can be eternally deadly. As always, the joy of salvation and the heaven-on-earth of a peaceful conscience are found only in the finished work of Christ and the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit.

Título: Stumbling Blocks
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In this edition of the Free Grace Broadcaster, entitled 
Stumbling Blocks
, James Durham introduces this crucial subject by explaining the importance and meaning of stumbling blocks. He begins by telling us that Christ condemned stumbling others. Octavius Winslow sets forth our Lord Jesus as the model for avoiding unnecessary offense. In a second article, James Durham gives us a lengthy list of the ways we stumble one another. You may be surprised to find that you stumble others more than you think! David Martyn Lloyd-Jones warns us never to stumble a believer, and Matthew Henry describes just how dreadful that sin is. One of the great sins of our generation is the abuse of Christian liberty; John Calvin addresses it biblically with clarity. Thomas Brooks helps us to see that strong saints must show Christlike, self-sacrificing love to weaker saints: do we practice self-denial in that way? One of the worst ways to stumble others is with false doctrine; William Perkins makes this clear. John Flavel reveals that the sins of God’s people and the ways those sins stumble others are a bag of poison cast by Satan! Briefly, Jonathan Edwards reveals the dangerous madness of stumbling ourselves. Finally, Matthew Henry reminds us that the incarnate Son of God did not please Himself. What a model we have in our precious Savior!

Título: Authority
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: This issue of the FGB presents the theme of Authority. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones announces our world’s desperate need of it. Stephen Charnock mines the Scriptures to display God’s absolute authority, and Jeff Pollard declares that God’s authority is revealed in the infallible, Spirit-breathed Word. In his second article, Dr. Lloyd-Jones takes up the subject of Christ’s authority manifested in His glorious Lordship. Benjamin Warfield describes how Jesus appointed His apostles, who lived and ministered with Him, to write the Gospels and the other New Testament writings. The Lord wanted His gospel call to salvation to spread throughout the world. Jean-Marc Berthoud teaches us about the importance of Christ’s authority in local churches. Now, do pastors, elders, and undershepherds have real authority in Christ’s churches? Arthur Pink clearly affirms and explains the necessity of such authority. In accord with this, elders have the responsibility of preaching God’s authoritative Word to Christ’s blood-bought people, ever setting the beauty and glory of His crucifixion and resurrection before them. Fathers too have authority, and Richard Baxter shows them how to use it to the glory of God and the good of their families. What about civil government? James Renihan shows us from Scripture and the 1689 Confession that magistrates are God’s authorized servants. Finally, C. H. Spurgeon blesses us with a moving declaration of Christ’s authority to save sinners!

Título: Precious Blood
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In this issue of the FGB, Precious Blood, Octavius Winslow introduces this glorious, soul-satisfying subject of Christ’s precious blood in the first of three articles. Thomas Brooks then shows us from Holy Scripture that the shedding of Christ’s blood was purposed in eternity but accomplished in history. Winslow then magnifies Christ Jesus as the Great High Priest, shedding His blood for His people and declaring, “The atoning blood of Immanuel is the divine bath of the soul.” The cleansing power of Christ’s blood is Stephen Charnock’s subject and shows, among other things, that it is the cause of our justification in God’s high court. In the same stream of holy, soul-elevating thought, John Flavel announces to the world that Christ’s precious blood has such great efficacy that by it God can forgive the greatest sinners! Charles Spurgeon adds that believers are not sanctified by the works of the law, but by the holy and precious blood that streamed from Jesus’ head, hands, and feet. In his second article, Thomas Brooks takes us to the throne of grace and shows us that our privilege of prayer was purchased by Christ’s blood. Spurgeon then magnifies Christ’s blood in the Lord’s Supper (meditating on this would be a great preparation for the next time you dine at Christ’s table!). Flavel then boldly proclaims that Jesus Christ is the only physician of sin-sick souls! O what a great Physician He is for the guilt stricken, sin-laden sinner! George Swinnock lifts our hearts to embrace and rejoice in regeneration, the Holy Spirit’s miracle purchased by Jesus’ precious blood. Closing this high, holy, and soul-rejoicing theme is Winslow’s third article: in it, he presses us with the impossibility of overestimating the value of Christ’s blood. O friends, delight your souls in the glorious truth of Christ’s precious blood—the purchase of our salvation.

Título: Peace
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: I often rise early in the quiet of morning to walk the streets of my neighborhood, praying for my neighbors. On one occasion, a man came out of his abode, and I struck up a conversation with him. I asked, “How can I be praying for you?” He answered, “Pray for world peace.” Here, I thought, was an open door to preach the gospel. I said, “I will be glad to pray for world peace, but that will only happen when the Prince of Peace reigns in every human heart.” I was not looking for a debate on end-times matters. I just wanted to tell him about the Prince of Peace, Who died on the cross at Golgotha as the sin-bearing Substitute of His people; the Prince Who rose again triumphantly the third day; the Prince Who secured eternal peace with God by shedding His blood for sinners. I wanted my neighbor to know that true peace came only by faith in Jesus Christ the Lord—peace with God and peace with others. His previous experiences with modern churches, however, left him uninterested. He smiled and went back inside his home. He was looking for another kind of peace.
 
Jesus spoke of two kinds of peace: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you” (Joh 14:27). The world offers seasons of peace—short seasons without war or calamities. Marxists, Islamists, New Agers, Globalists, and others promise worldwide peace. Of course, what they mean is that the world will be at peace when they rule it. Promised peace attracts diehard, even fanatical, devotees in vast numbers. But man’s depraved nature never has and never will bring lasting peace to this world. My neighbor will be disappointed with the peace the world offers.
 
In stark contrast to the failed human efforts for peace, anyone who repents of his sins and believes on the crucified and resurrected God-man Jesus Christ can and does know a peace with God that can never fade away. Consider Paul’s exhortation to the Philippians: “In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Phi 4:6-7). Peace that passes all understanding—Paul knew experientially about that peace, even as he wrote to the Philippian believers from prison. He knew, as God’s children know, that Christ’s peace cannot be taken from us. Arthur Pink illustrates that peace: “A tyrant once threatened a saint, ‘I will destroy your home’—you cannot destroy my peace. ‘I will confiscate your goods’—you cannot rob me of my peace. ‘I will banish you from your country’—I will take my peace with me.” O my friends, do you know that peace? Do you quiet your heart with Christ’s peace regardless of the providential experiences that come your way?
 
To encourage all Christ’s blood-bought people with this great peace, we offer this quarter’s Free Grace Broadcaster: 
Peace

Following that, we learn from the Westminster Assembly about the many and diverse duties required by the Fifth Commandment and the surprising list of sins against it. Thomas Watson describes in detail what honoring one’s parents includes. Children’s duties to their parents and God’s promise to faithful children are the focus of William Plumer’s article. In a second article, Thomas Watson takes up the subject of honoring “other” fathers, that is, other authorities in our life. Reformer Pierre Viret describes reasons why it is appropriate to disobey our “fathers.” Then Jonathan Edwards explores the many ways our obedience honors our Heavenly Father. Arthur Pink moves our hearts by describing Jesus keeping the Fifth Commandment while dying in agony on cross. Lastly, Octavius Winslow speaks of the glory of Christ in His submission to parental authority.

Título: Do You Go to the Prayer Meeting?
Autor: Horatius Bonar
Descrição: "Reader! Is there a prayer meeting in your neighborhood? If there is, do you attend it? If you do not, have you good reasons for staying away?" This is the way this convicting and encouraging tract begins. Bonar reminds us of the blessing and importance of prayer meetings and exhorts his readers to attend, if at all possible. In this urgent call, he asks, "Have you no time to attend prayer meetings? Is this your reason? Ah! Think for a moment, is it really true that you have no time to spare for them? Can you say so honestly before God? Will you be able to plead this with the Judge in the great day of account? Do you never attend meetings which take up more of your time? Or do you not waste more time idly, or in foolish company, than would be spent at the meeting? What? Have you time to eat, and to drink, and make merry, but none to pray? Have you time for business, for company, for folly, for pleasure, for lusts, for sin, but none for prayer? Have you time for the shop, the market, the ballroom, the card table, the public house, the political club—but none for prayer? You can spare days and weeks for the things of time. Can you not spare an hour for the things of eternity?"

Descrição: This issue of the FGB is about 
Your Adversary
, since every Christian needs to know who we are facing in this spiritual battle. Arthur Pink’s first article asks a question: Is the devil just a figment of our imagination? Pink answers that the Word of God gives conclusive evidence that the devil is real. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones gives us a biblical survey of the Bible’s teaching about our adversary the devil. In a second article, Arthur Pink gives us a clear and helpful biblical exposition of the personal characteristics and acts that prove the devil to be a real person. Thomas Manton reveals that Scripture tells the story of the raging war between Satan and God’s people down through the ages. Charles Spurgeon warns believers and urges them to realize that Satan watches and considers the weaknesses of believers; based on those weaknesses, he plans his temptations and attacks. Thankfully, Thomas Brooks then gives us ten helps against Satan’s devices and schemes. This is a wonderful list of stratagems against the adversary’s cunning tricks and traps. We also see how to resist the devil in William Perkins’ fictional dialogue between Satan and a Christian. Jonathan Edwards unfolds the extraordinary wisdom of God in the way He outwitted and overthrew our adversary. In his second article, Spurgeon gives us the ultimate weapon for overcoming Satan—the blood of Jesus Christ the Lamb of God. What a feast and encouragement for the beleaguered soul! And once again, Jonathan Edwards cheers and strengthens our hearts with knowledge that the days of our suffering physically and spiritually by the schemes and attacks of Satan will end with the adversary cast into the lake of fire for eternity. The last article in this issue leaves us with a warning about Satan’s devious, unrelenting warfare against the unity of Christ’s blood-bought people. O children of God, let us love one another as Christ loved us (Joh 15:12): let us not “bite and devour one another” (Gal 5:15), which is our adversary’s work; but let us exalt Christ and defeat our adversary by keeping “the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Eph 4:1-3).

Título: Christian Unity
Autor: Autor Desconhecido
Descrição: In this issue of the FGB on 
Christian Unity
, Arthur W. Pink introduces Christian unity as the fruit of regeneration. Matthew Henry then explains from Scripture that this unity has its origin in the oneness of the members of the Godhead. Charles Spurgeon describes the unity that Christ prayed for, contrasting it with man-made movements and denominations. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones then beautifully describes the spiritual nature of unity in Christ’s body. Following that, Anthony Burgess discusses the difference between visible and invisible unity. A second article by Lloyd-Jones lists helpful steps for guarding the Spirit’s unity among Christ’s people. Thomas Smyth offers us twelve rules for promoting harmony among church members, and another article by Anthony Burgess exhorts ministers to seek unity among themselves. The unity of pastors and members of Christ’s churches is important; Andrew Fuller guides in securing it. In his third article, Burgess expounds the excellence of unity and how it brings the world to believe the truth of Christ’s saving mercies. Spurgeon’s second article calls us to the crucial work needed in accomplishing Christian unity. We conclude with Jeremiah Burroughs explaining the excellence and beauty of peace, love, and harmony among the blood-bought people of God. May the Lord help us to see and pursue it.
