Código: doelp,Título: A doutrina da eleição,Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: Como a doutrina da eleição é uma parte do alto tema da soberania de Deus, uma breve palavra sobre ela primeiro. Em Apocalipse 19:6 nos é dito, “o Senhor Deus onipotente reina”. No céu e na terra, Ele é o controlador e ordenador de todas as criaturas. Como o Altíssimo, Ele governa entre os exércitos dos céus e ninguém pode deter a mão ou dizer-lhe: “Que fazes?” (Jó 9:12). Ele é o todo-poderoso, que faz todas as coisas segundo o con-selho da Sua própria vontade. Ele é o Oleiro celestial, que toma conta de nossa huma-nidade caída como um pedaço de barro, e para fora dela forja um como vaso para honra e outro vaso para desonra. Em suma, Ele é o decisivo e determinante do destino de cada homem e o controlador de cada detalhe na vida de cada indivíduo, o que é apenas outra maneira de dizer que Deus é Deus.",Preço: 0.69,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/doelp/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=doelp&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: hlovfg,Título: A Husband's Love,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: With love for Christ and a burning desire to help men understand their God-ordained roles as husbands, we offer this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster, 
A Husband’s Love. 
Matthew Henry sets the stage for the rest of the articles with his comments on Genesis 2—man’s responsibility to love his wife began in the Garden of Eden. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones then describes a Christlike love for us, since the Lord Jesus is the model from which husbands must learn how to love. What are the responsibilities of such a love? Ezekiel Hopkins gives us an overview. John Angell James then gives us a detailed survey of how Christ loved His church. In a second article, Lloyd-Jones carefully and biblically explains how men may love their wives as they love themselves. In a profound and deeply challenging article, Benjamin Palmer gives us insight into the force of love, the abuse of authority, and the affect these have on a woman’s heart. This article may be a difficult read for some, but it is worth repeated and prayerful reading. Men know well how to love themselves, and John Angell James appeals to them to apply the same to their wives. And who better than Charles Spurgeon can take the golden example of Christ loving His church and bringing it home to a husband’s heart? He does so with great power, clarity, and verve. Finally, with a heart full of Puritan fire, George Swinnock offers up a husband’s prayer for the grace to love as Christ and for the spiritual wellbeing of his dear wife. These articles will richly repay those who prayerfully apply them.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/hlovfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=hlovfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=hlovfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Second, Adoniram Judson set an example of total commitment to inspire missionaries in enduring the inevitable strains peculiar to their calling.

In his spiritual classic 
Human Nature in Its Fourfold State, 
Thomas Boston lists eight ""cases"" where a true Christian might have spiritual doubts about the authenticity of his faith. Such doubts, Boston notes, ""may hinder some persons from the comfortable view of their happy state."" Thus, he writes to encourage, comfort, and assure those saints who are burdened with such doubts.

Implore the Holy Spirit to grant us a deeper conviction of its enormity.
 
Make it a subject of earnest prayer that we may be delivered from this evil.
 
Watch for its beginning, and as soon as we detect an anxious, unbelieving thought, lift up our heart to God and ask for deliverance.
 
According to Pink, the best antidote for anxiety is frequent meditation on God’s goodness, power, and sufficiency, realizing from Psalm 23 that “The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.”",Preço: 0.05,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/anxi/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=anxi&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

He that is most loaded seems the most likely to pass in and begin the heavenward journey; but what ails the other men? This is what I want to find out. Poor fellows! they have come a long way already to get where they are; and the King’s highway, which they seek, is right before them: why do they not take to the Pilgrim Road at once?…Only the Lord Himself can …lead them to take the great decisive step. Yet the Lord works by means; and I have prepared this little book in the earnest hope that He may work by it to the blessed end of leading seekers to an immediate, simple trust in the Lord Jesus.”          —

Código: boc2,"Título: Benefits of Christ, The",Autor: Don Benedetto,"Descrição: The Benefits of Christ 
was arguably the most popular book of the short lived Italian Reformation. It is estimated that 40,000 to 80,000 copies were printed between 1541-1548, of which very few remain today due to the fact that most were burned once the title was placed on the list of prohibited books during the Inquisition. The treatise was originally published anonymously under the title 
Trattato Ultilissimo Del Beneficio Di Geisu Christo Crocifisso
, and was for a few hundred years mistakenly attributed to Aonio Paleario (1503-1570), a martyr for the Reformation cause in Italy. But most scholars now agree, based on records from the Inquisition itself, that the “Trattato” was written by Don Benedetto, a student of the Spanish Reformer Juan de Valdes (1498?-1541) and friend of Peter Martyr Vermigli (1499- 1562).

 is considered by many to be Luther’s most important book, and it stands today as one of the great classics in Christian history. He wrote in 1525 at the beginning of the Reformation in answer to a work by Erasmus, the classical scholar and humanist (1469-1536). Both Erasmus and Luther rejected many of the erroneous practices of the Roman Catholic church. But Luther went further to challenge the Roman teaching of salvation by works. Erasmus pleased the Pope by writing to uphold the Roman dogma of “free will,” that man could of himself decide to choose for his salvation. Luther saw correctly that the Biblical doctrines of the depravity of man and salvation by faith alone stand together. He declared Erasmus to be an enemy of the faith, and wrote 
The Bondage of the Will
 to establish this doctrine at the core of evangelicalism. The

Código: ceot,"Título: Candid Examination of the Scofield Bible, A",Autor: Albertus Pieters,"Descrição: “The Scofield Bible may be called perhaps the most influential single work thrust into the religious life of America during the twentieth century. Those who use this work are, in other respects, among the best Christians in our churches. These good people do not lack faith and zeal, but they sadly lack knowledge; and the tragedy of the situation lies just here, that this is the very thing they think they have obtained from the Scofield Bible! In general Bible knowledge, Scofield makes many mistakes, and in his eschatology he goes far astray from anything the Church has ever believed.”
 
This booklet holds four erroneous doctrinal areas of the Scofield Bible up to biblical light to reveal its errors and set the reader on the right path of orthodox Christianity: 1) artificial typology, 2) doctrine of dispensations and covenants, 3) eschatology, and 4) doctrine of the church.",Preço: 0.00,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/ceot/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ceot&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ceot&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: NÃO
Código: codo,"Título: Canons of Dort, The",Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: The Canons of Dort
 
is the explanation of the judicial decision regarding objections to the faith of the Reformation, from the official church council held in The Netherlands in 1618-1619. Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609) was a Dutch theologian and prominent pastor in Amsterdam. He was eloquent and well educated, his sermons attracting large audiences not only for their content but for their controversy. According to Arminius, the orthodox faith of the Reformation was wrong. He taught that God chooses for salvation only those whom He has foreseen will believe. By 1592 Arminius had been formally accused of heresy. In 1610, his zealous followers presented five objections to the standard confessions of faith from the Reformation; the theology behind these objections came to be called 
Arminianism. 
 
The whole church was caught up with theological debate, and a council was called to resolve the controversy. The Synod of Dort concluded with a rejection of Arminianism, and in 
The Canons of Dort 
set forth the orthodox Reformed doctrine on each point; today these are sometimes referred to as 
the doctrines of grace

Código: cfba,"Título: Catechism for Boys and Girls, A",Autor: Erroll Hulse,"Descrição: This simple catechism is very helpful for teaching young children to understand and remember the basic truths of the Christian faith.
The  Westminster Assembly produced not only its well-known Confession of Faith, but also the Longer Catechism (for pastors’ use in teaching their congregations) and Shorter Catechism (for parents’ use in teaching their children). Soon thereafter, Benjamin Keach (1640-1704) tailored the Westminster Shorter Catechism to the London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 (which is based on the Westminster except in its chapters on church government, the covenants, and baptism). Later, Charles Spurgeon (1834-1892) updated Keach’s catechism for his own congregation. 
 
More recently, Erroll Hulse knew that a more simplified Baptist catechism was needed so that parents could train their young children at home. The 134 short questions and answers encompass all the key doctrines of the faith, including sections on God-Man-Sin, Salvation, The Ten Commandments, Prayer, The Word, The Church and Ordinances, and Last Things.",Preço: 0.61,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/cfba/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cfba&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cfba&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Not only that, but we should consider ourselves travelers in a foreign land, for this world was never meant to be our home.

First, recognize that good works flow from faith and not the other way around. Second, be careful to insure that the works one does are actually good—here Bunyan describes the duties of Christians in the family and other relationships.

Pink illustrates why those Christians who are “lopsided in their theology” may be considered foolish. They are lopsided in that they believe some scriptures, but not all scriptures because they are “unable to harmonize the two different parts of God’s truth.” Indeed, tying themselves down to a theological system, they “place a higher value on 
consistency
 than they do fidelity.” He expands on this under four headings: using reason rather than faith, holding to a theology that is narrower than scripture, viewing the various parts of God’s word in a disproportionate way, and “proving” truth by creed and logic. In summary, Pink gives a timely admonishment to all believers, counseling them to insure that they fit their theology to Scripture rather than Scripture to their theology.",Preço: 0.52,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/cfoo/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cfoo&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cfoo&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: cmod,Título: Christian Modesty,Autor: Jeff Pollard,"Descrição: God’s Word has much to say about the way we dress, especially in worship. 
Christian Modesty and the Public Undressing of America
 examines relevant portions of Scripture and investigates a little fashion history in order to present a Biblical doctrine of modesty. This is an important discussion for both men and women. While this controversial subject often falls into the realm of subjective experience and speculation, the author begins with a study of Holy Scripture. An examination of fashion authorities and historians of modern culture also reveals that the fashion industry, which believes that sexual attraction equals beauty, has been hard at work convincing society to undress in public. Because of its unbiblical worldview, the fashion industry persistently justifies the exposure and the sensualizing of the human body, a trend that many undiscerning Christians have unfortunately adopted.

Código: csot,Título: Christian Survey of the Old Testament,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: A Christian Survey of the Old Testament
 explores how the Old Covenant prepares for the New Covenant in Christ in dramatic and mysterious ways. We see God’s character displayed in the beginnings of the world and of man. But sin appears, and its terrible consequences bring the just judgments of God. God then shows His love and mercy in setting apart one family to become His very own people. God redeems them from slavery, gives them His Law, and declares to them His holiness—and they willingly enter into a national covenant with Him. By God’s grace, they become a great nation reflecting the Kingdom of God: His people, in His place, under His rule. By His prescribed sacrifices, sinners can live with the holy God in their midst. Yet from this blessed place, the united kingdom divides, and Israel and then Judah fall prey to pride, idolatry, formalism, and spiritual adultery. God sends His prophets to their kings, repeatedly calling the nation to repentance and faith. But the people will not hear, and God dramatically uses new empires to judge His very own. Even then, however, there is hope in God’s gracious promises: a Redeemer will come to deliver once and for all His people from their sins.
 
“The knowledge of God…appears throughout as an internal expansion, an organic unfolding from within…The gospel of Paradise is such a germ in which the gospel of Paul is potentially present: and the gospel of Abraham, of Moses, of David, of Isaiah and Jeremiah, are all expansions of this original message of salvation, each pointing forward to the next stage of growth and bringing the gospel idea one step nearer to its full realization.”—

Many current trends in the wedding practices among evangelical Christians are not contributing to the vital function of the church as “the pillar and ground of the truth” (1Ti 3:15). Nothing but thorough biblical reformation will once again cause the truth of the gospel to shine with penetrating brilliance before the eyes of men.

He first explains why there is no such warfare for an unbeliever. In short, the unbeliever hates the law of God and will not obey it, happily pandering to his sinful flesh. But when he comes to Christ, this is all changed. He can now truly say that he loves God’s law, which has been written on his heart. He soon discovers, however, that this sets off continuing conflict against indwelling sin. In the midst of these battles, the believer feels wretched about his sin, seeks the Lord for deliverance, and gives thanks for each victory. The fight against the flesh never ceases in this life, but according to McCheyne, there is a sure promise that in the end sin shall be rooted out altogether.",Preço: 0.17,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/cwar/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cwar&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: cdisfg,Título: Church Discipline,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Why are American churches so weak, powerless, worldly, and increasingly irrelevant in our culture? D. M. Lloyd-Jones gives us at least one reason by asking, ""When did you last hear any reference from a Christian pulpit to the subject of discipline? How often have you heard sermons or addresses on the subject? The word has almost gone right out of existence and what it stands for and represents has fallen into disuse.""
 
In light of this, this Free Grace Broadcaster takes up Church Discipline. R. Albert Mohler, Jr., introduces this crucial subject by explaining the historical and cultural reasons that church discipline has vanished from American churches. Hezekiah Harvey then biblically defines church discipline. James Bannerman reveals from Scripture that discipline did not originate with human tradition: it was a positive institution by Jesus Christ the Head of the Church. John Gill then instructs us in the biblical ways that a church admits people to or excludes them from its membership. In a second article, Mohler demonstrates that Christ-instituted discipline preserves the visible purity of those who profess the name of the risen Christ. Daniel Wray explains the necessity of discipline, followed by a third article from Mohler that describes the three vital areas that require discipline. What are the modes of church discipline? What is Christ's church authorized to do in this matter? Daniel Wray answers these questions for us. Excommunication is a difficult subject, and Jonathan Edwards details the nature of this severe discipline. No one can practice this in church life without encountering objections. Wray gives answers to a few of the more common ones. Finally, Charles Spurgeon exhorts us personally and as congregations of Christ Jesus to keep the Lord's chruch pure.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/cdisfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cdisfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cdisfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

—Matthew 11:28-30
 
These are, perhaps, the best known and most frequently heard words which Jesus ever spoke. They are read at church services, funerals, and many other occasions. They are often called “the comfortable words.” But what do they mean? What does it mean to “come” to Jesus? Who is He, and why should we “come” to Him? In this attractive presentation of the Christian faith, Tom Wells answers these questions. In an engaging style he explains who Jesus Christ is and what it means to “come” to Him. He writes honestly about the barriers which stand in the way of faith, and about the cost involved in being a disciple.

The 'God of all comfort' (2Co 1:3) is very tender of them, and it is His revealed will that His servants should bind up the broken-hearted and pour the balm of Gilead into their wounds. What cause have we to exclaim: 'Who is a God like unto thee' (Mic 7:18), Who has provided for the comfort of those who were rebels against His government and transgressors of His Law.

According to Pink, studying these truths should teach us humility, caution, and reverence. Pink goes on to explain that God is all-sufficient in Himself and to Himself. He can receive nothing from another nor be limited by the power of another. Finally, as the Supreme Sovereign of the universe, God exercises His sovereignty according to His own imperial and righteous pleasure. He has mercy on whom He will, and whom He will He hardens.

Código: coza,Título: Conversion of Zaccheus,Autor: George Whitefield,"Descrição: In this booklet, Great Awakening evangelist George Whitefield uses the conversion of Zaccheus to illustrate that salvation is a free gift of God. He shows, in the first place, that there is nothing in Zaccheus that makes him fit for salvation. On the contrary, as a publican, he was “in all probability a notorious sinner.” Whitefield further points out that Jesus calls him by name. Zaccheus had come to see Jesus out of curiosity, but according to His sovereign, electing grace, Jesus, who had known this man from eternity, now effectually calls him in time. Concluding his sermon, Whitefield implores his listeners, “Make haste, O ye publicans and sinners, and give the dear Lord Jesus your hearts, your whole hearts.” He ends with a plaintive prayer, “O that you may know the things that belong to your everlasting peace, before they are eternally hid from your eyes.”",Preço: 0.52,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/coza/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=coza&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=coza&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

In the cross Christ accomplished great things for us, bringing us life, making peace, and removing the wall of partition.

Código: cbea,Título: Cross-Bearing,Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: In this tract, A. W. Pink examines Matthew 16:24 which consists of three elements—denying one’s self, taking up one’s cross, and following Christ. Pink indicates that denying one’s self isn’t limited to simply giving up things we like, but means “being done with self” completely. He likens this to Romans 12:1, “Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.” Taking up one’s cross is essentially embracing an instrument of death. According to Pink, the cross stands for several hallmarks of Christ’s life—the world’s hatred, voluntary surrender to the will of God, and sacrificial suffering and death. His conclusion is this: legally, the cross of Christ stands alone as it put away the guilt of our sins, but as deliverance from the power of sin in our lives, the cross is to be shared by all believers.",Preço: 0.14,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/cbea/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cbea&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Thomas Boston begins by explaining his application of the text as follows, “The point I intend to speak to from these words is: the delaying and putting off of repentance is a soul-ruining course among gospel-hearers.” As he expounds on this, Boston shows why gospel-hearers delay repentance and why such a delay is so extremely dangerous. He points out that most have not decided they will 
never
 repent, but just not right now, and then offers nine reasons why this might be the case.

Código: dreg,Título: Decisional Regeneration,Autor: James Adams,"Descrição: Decisional Regeneration
 has permeated much of the Christian Church in a deceptive way. Like Baptismal Regeneration, it sees the new birth as the result of a mechanical process that man performs, ignoring the sovereign work of God in giving men new hearts. The practice of Decisional Regeneration in the Church must be exposed—in order to save men from the damning delusion that because they have ""decided"" or ""signed a card,"" they are going to heaven and are no longer under the wrath of God. The purpose of this booklet is not to question the sincerity of some Christians or to malign them, but to unite Christians in biblical truth. The gospel alone is the power of God unto salvation and the true basis of Christian unity.

Pink begins this tract by defining God’s decrees, declaring that they consist of “His purpose or determination with respect to future things.” Indeed, they “relate to all future things without exception: whatever is done in time was foreordained before time began.” Pink goes on to give four major properties of God’s decrees. First, they are eternal. That is, they were not done in time, but in eternity. Second, the decrees of God are wise. This wisdom is “shown in the selection of the best possible ends and of the fittest means of accomplishing them.” Third, they are free. His determinations were influenced by no external cause. And fourth, they are absolute and unconditional. Their execution is not dependent on any condition which may or may not be performed. Pink concludes with encouraging words—“how thankful we should be that everything is determined by infinite wisdom and goodness.”",Preço: 0.14,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/dogo/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dogo&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

 Puritan pastor and author Richard Baxter exhorts readers to take seriously the disciplines of hearing the Word preached, reading the Scriptures, and reading Christian books. It seems that some view hearing a sermon as a passive exercise and therefore miss out on the profit they could gain from it. Baxter highlights the importance of this means of grace and how our approach should reflect a keen appreciation of it. He urges us to come prayerfully, heartily, attentively, and with purpose. He then stirs the reader to a right approach to reading the Scriptures, the attitude with which to approach them, and thoughts on methods of study.

Código: dhea,Título: Divine Healing,Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: In this booklet, A. W. Pink stakes out a Scriptural position that avoids two extremes regarding divine healing. These extremes include on the one hand, false teaching about divine healing—for example, the belief that healing is in the atonement—and on the other hand, the erroneous view that God 
never
 heals today. He elaborates on divine healing by first considering unscriptural teaching on the subject and then turning to what he calls “the positive side” of this issue. Under the latter, Pink looks at the general subject of human health and the duties and privileges of Christians in illness. Finally, he considers the implications of three well-known passages of Scripture—2 Chronicles 7:14, Matthew 9:29, and James 5:14-16.",Preço: 0.87,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/dhea/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dhea&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dhea&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: dsah,Título: Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility,Autor: James Innell Packer,"Descrição: Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility
 is a thoughtful examination of these two important doctrines of the Christian faith as they relate to God’s grace in salvation. There is abroad today a widespread suspicion that a robust faith in the absolute sovereignty of God is bound to undermine any adequate sense of human responsibility. The Bible presents both of these as true: 1) God’s sovereignty in electing some people to be saved, and 2) all peoples’ responsibility to call upon the Lord to be saved. Many err when they try to reconcile these two truths. They either affirm sovereignty and avoid calling men to turn to God; or they focus on encouraging men to “invite Christ into their hearts” and teach that God does not rule sovereignly over all of life. In this booklet, both truths are upheld as vital. One must not be neglected in order to be comfortable with the other. The author shows us how both truths coexist in the infinitely wise economy of God.

And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
 He points out that simply knowing 
about
 Christ will not change the sinner’s condition of spiritual death. To have eternal life, he must know Christ by intimate personal experience. Pollard goes on to explain the gospel in terms of Christ’s three offices. Jesus came as Prophet so that man might know God’s will. He came as Priest to offer Himself a sacrifice for the sins of His people. And He came as the sovereign King who grants His people faith and repentance leading to salvation. Conclusion: 
He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.

In his clear and winsome style, Ryle first explains that conversion—in his words—is a scriptural thing, a real thing, a necessary thing, a possible thing, a happy thing, and a thing that may be seen. After expounding on these, he urges the reader to “Find out if you are converted” and “If you are not converted, never rest till you are.” Finally, Ryle has the following advice for those who believe they are converted: make your calling and conversion sure, remember that a converted man is still a sinner needing Christ every day, labor to grow in grace as long as you live, and lastly, share your faith. As Ryle puts it: “Never, never if you are a converted man, never be content to go to heaven alone!”",Preço: 0.61,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/dyty/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dyty&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dyty&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Pink, a review of church history shows that there have been a number of errors regarding the doctrine of assurance, each of which calls for a different approach in preaching and teaching. These errors include the belief that no assurance of salvation is possible, or that assurance is too easily assumed because of casual “decisions for Christ,” or too difficult to believe in the face of indwelling sin. Pink goes on to offer a thorough Scriptural exposition of the doctrine under four headings: the nature of assurance, its basis, its attainment, and its hindrance, maintenance, and fruit. He concludes by offering several dialogues—with characters like Carnal Confidence and Humble Heart—which are designed to further explain and amplify his main points.",Preço: 2.05,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/doas/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=doas&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=doas&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

He reveals his motivation for writing up front, declaring that there was a time when justification was one of the best known doctrines of the Christian faith, but among many in his time there was almost total ignorance of this truth. He opens up the doctrine under nine headings: justification’s meaning, its problem, its basis, its nature, its source, its objects, its instrument, its evidence, and its results. In conclusion, Pink points out that while the Christian’s justification is complete the moment he truly believes in Christ, the following distinctions can be noted: justification was decreed from all eternity, was effective when Christ rose from the dead, is actuated when the Christian believes, felt when the Spirit bestows assurance, manifested on the path of obedience, and pronounced by God publicly at the Day of Judgment.",Preço: 2.05,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/doju/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=doju&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=doju&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Turning to the parents, Adams admonishes them to “Rule over your children in such a way that they love and honor you for it.” Finally, after describing their many practical duties, he urges parents to be faithful in two foundational ways—praying always for their children and setting a good example in the way they live.",Preço: 0.61,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/doca/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=doca&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=doca&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

 challenges our complacency toward the issue of Bible translation by asking the very simple question: “By what standard” are we to judge the authority and reliability of translations of the Bible into modern languages? With clarity and brevity, William Einwechter shows that there are biblical criteria for judging the reliability of English translations. Therefore, the Christian is not at liberty to simply choose one that suits his fancy, and the church cannot be indifferent in the selection of a translation for public use. With the very integrity of God’s Word at stake, the conscientious believer cannot be pro-choice on the issue of Bible translations!",Preço: 1.92,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/ebtb/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ebtb&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ebtb&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

is an excerpt from 
The Marrow of Modern Divinity
 by Edward Fisher (c.1612-c.1657). 
The Marrow
 influentially stated the doctrine of unconditional grace, advocating a free offer of the gospel without condition. It was at the center of the later Marrow Controversy.
 
Here Fisher gives a dialogue between a gospel minister and struggling souls to correct misconceptions regarding the Law, grace, and works. Fisher urges, ""Come to Christ by believing that He will accept of you, justify, and save you freely by His grace, according to His gracious promise. This is neither pride nor presumption: for Christ having tendered and offered it to you freely, believe it, it is true humility of heart to take what Christ offers you.""",Preço: 0.87,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/etsg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=etsg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=etsg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: efyl,Título: Escape For Your Life,Autor: Joel Beeke,"Descrição: Comparing God’s September 11, 2001, judgment on America to His ancient judgment on Sodom, Joel Beeke examines heaven’s somber message to our sinful nation and, more personal, to those who have ignored or rejected the gospel. He addresses the latter in words spoken by the angel just prior to Sodom’s devastation, “Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed” (Gen. 19:17). From this passage he admonishes unbelievers:
 
 
Realize your danger (you are under the wrath of God, just like Sodom).
 
Forsake all (you must give up everything to follow Christ).
 
Run for your life (you must flee this wicked world).
 
 
Beeke sums it up this way, “Oh, I beseech you, run for your life; run straight to Christ. Don’t run to ceremonies, feelings, ministers, works, orthodoxies—but run straight to Christ.”",Preço: 0.14,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/efyl/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=efyl&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Because an offended God is righteous, holy, and just. Because natural man is an incorrigible sinner with the wrath of a sin-hating God abiding on him. Because the sinner is in alarming danger; the punishment that awaits him is awful, hopeless, unendurable, and endless. In a word, Herendeen wrote to give sinners a solemn warning. He does this by expounding on the nature of hell, the sinner’s great folly, and the ferocity of God’s wrath.

Código: fogo,"Título: Faithfulness of God, The",Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: According to A. W. Pink, many in the church are ignorant of the scriptural meaning of foreknowledge. Because of this ignorance, it is easy for unlearned teachers to spread erroneous doctrine. A common error is the following: in opposition to the clear teaching of Scripture that God sovereignly chose certain people for salvation, these teachers argue that God, in His “foreknowledge,” looked into the future and saw that certain people would believe—and so predestined them to salvation. This turns Scripture on its head, making man the final arbiter of his salvation rather than God. In repudiating this error, Pink explains the true meaning of foreknowledge as taught in Scripture, showing that it is “never used in connection with events or actions, but always refers to persons.” It is individual people that God is said to foreknow, not the actions of those people.",Preço: 0.17,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/fogo/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=fogo&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: fathfg,Título: Fatherhood,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Matthew Henry said, “Masters of families, who preside in the other affairs of the house, must go before their households in the things of God. They must be as prophets, priests, and kings in their own families; and as such they must keep up family-doctrine, family-worship, and family-discipline.” The master of a family in Henry’s time was the male head of a household—usually a husband or father. The Reformers and Puritans often spoke of fathers this way. The biblical vision of fatherhood that arises from the pages of Scripture is beautiful, majestic, and holy. It is also foreign to the day in which we live.
 
As Henry points out, fathers “must go before their households in the things of God.” The biblical picture of a father is of one who leads his family according to the Word of God. He is a representative of God and Christ. This means that he must be a man of prayer, of the Word, and of humble holiness. By faith in Christ, trusting in His grace, empowered by His Spirit, and informed by the Word, a father must keep up “family doctrine.” This means he should be able to teach his family the truths of God’s Word. He must keep up “family worship.” His home must be a place where he leads his loved ones in the worship of the thrice-holy Triune God, in prayer, in the reading of Scripture, and in song. And he must keep up “family discipline.” That is, he must govern his home under Christ, blessing the obedient and chastening the disobedient—all under the grace, mercy, and love of Jesus Christ the Lord. He must learn from Christ, walk with Christ, and model Christ’s truth in his home.
 
Do we understand fatherhood this way? Along with many other biblical doctrines, the biblical doctrine of fatherhood has fallen on hard times. Our decaying and perverse culture needs a mighty generation of biblical fathers to rise up from the ashes of authoritarianism, abdicationism, selfism, feminism, and same-sex-ism to follow Christ, whatever the cost.
 
With this in mind, we offer the latest issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster, 
Fatherhood. 
William Gurnall briefly introduces us to this subject by describing a father’s roles as a 
prophet
 to instruct the family, a 
king
 to govern the family, and a 
priest
 to lead the family in the worship of God. Arthur W. Pink then helps us understand that fatherhood is a responsibility and a privilege, as a father instructs his children, models the Christian life for them, disciplines them, and prays for them. John Calvin explains a father’s main responsibility. Richard Baxter writes that, in order to properly lead a family for Christ, a father must understand and maintain biblical authority in his home, skill in governing, and holiness of life. We then learn from Nicholas Byfield that a father must be godly. What does this look like? Byfield tells us by giving us a list of signs by which fathers may identify Christ’s work in their hearts. To be a “prophet” in his home, a father must teach the Word of God, says Thomas Doolittle; and to be effectual in that good work, he, as a “priest,” must be a man of prayer. Every father knows that bringing up children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord is a difficult task; for this reason, William Gouge discusses the loving discipline that a father must exercise as “king” in his home. However, Thomas Watson makes abundantly clear that fathers must act prudently toward their children: otherwise, they can provoke them to wrath. Having considered all this, what practical steps can a man take to accomplish it? Richard Baxter gives clear, helpful, biblical counsel to fathers who would reform their families in the name of Jesus Christ. Finally, George Swinnock concludes this subject with an earnest, heartfelt prayer to be the father that Christ has saved him to be.

Código: fog2fg,"Título: Fear of God, The",Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: The Word of God tells us, ""The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom"" (Pro 9:10). This is strange language to the ears of the world. Unfortunately, it also seems to be strange to many of God's children. No doubt there are many reasons for this; but standing at the head of the line is that sobering reality that 
nothing 
deprives us of our joys and pleasures like fear. Edmund Burke said, ""No passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as fear.""
 
Fear...strength withers in its presence. Happiness flees. It's a fact woven into the fabric of our daily lives. This is why we often think of fear only in that dreadful sense of anxiety when we face the presence of danger...So we usually conclude that fear is to be avoided at all costs.
 
Yet the Bible tells us the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Christians often misunderstand what the fear of God is. How are we to understand this? How can we fear God and love Him at the same time? This issue of the Broadcaster attempts to answer these questions and to bring some clarity to this most important subject. From A.W. Pink's and Charles Bridges' short and helpful articles to the lengthier discourses by A'Brakel, Gill, Bunyan, and Spurgeon, there is a clear Biblical unfolding of this glorious theme. Our prayer is that you will find much help and edification as you digest each of these blessed articles.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/fog2fg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=fog2fg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=fog2fg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

He compares the love the Spirit brings to four things. First, it is like a winnowing fan blowing away the excesses of our lusts and self-indulgence. Second, it is like a priceless jewel, incalculable in value. Third, it is a rich and rare picture painted by a Master, the great designer of all things beautiful.

In this passage the Apostle Paul declares that God foreknows, predestines, calls, justifies, and glorifies every true Christian. The chain cannot be broken. If God does one of these things, He does them all. And if He does them all, then every person that He foreknows He will surely glorify. This should give believers great encouragement and hope for the future. As the author says, “Whereas these facts have to do with your personal and eternal salvation, none of them depend upon you for their fulfillment, but were determined long before you ever existed and are according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace (Eph. 1:5-6).",Preço: 0.05,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/ffec/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ffec&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

At that time, we will see a great harvest and a perfect church without spot or wrinkle, but until then the wheat and tares will grow together.

He notes that those who flee ought not to look back. Sodom is a city full of filthiness and abominations with nothing worth looking back upon, and it is a city appointed to swift and sudden destruction—a destruction that will be exceedingly dreadful, universal, and everlasting. Edwards solemnly warns those who are in a “natural condition” to flee, pointing out that the world is divided into two cities—the holy and beloved city of Zion, and the polluted and accursed city of Sodom.

for the ungodly
. Expanding on this truth, he first lays out the hopeless condition of the ungodly, moving from there to the truth that Christ died for sinners just like them, and on to the plain inferences that may be drawn from this. For the ungodly these inferences are twofold. First, they are already under God’s wrath and in great danger. Second, only Christ can deliver them out of this danger and only through His death. Spurgeon concludes by addressing the believers in his congregation, urging them to make the truth of Romans 5:6 the central message of their lives.

Código: fogi,Título: Foreknowledge of God  (in election),Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: According to A. W. Pink, many in the church are ignorant of the Scriptural meaning of foreknowledge. Because of this ignorance, it is easy for unlearned teachers to spread erroneous doctrine. The most common error is the following: in opposition to the clear teaching of Scripture that God sovereignly chose certain people for salvation, these teachers argue that God, in His “foreknowledge,” looked into the future and saw that certain people would believe—and so predestined them to salvation. This turns Scripture on its head, making man the final arbiter of his salvation rather than God. In repudiating this error, Pink explains the true meaning of foreknowledge as taught in Scripture, showing that it is “never used in connection with events or actions, but always refers to persons.” It is individual people that God is said to foreknow, not the actions of those people.",Preço: 0.17,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/fogi/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=fogi&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

In the first place, we learn that formal religion (that which is based on outward manifestations only) is not true religion and that a formal Christian is not a Christian in God’s sight. Secondly, we learn that the heart is the seat of true religion and that the true Christian is the Christian in heart. Thirdly, we learn that true religion must never expect to be popular—it will not have the “praise of man, but of God.” Ryle ends by addressing three types of people—formal Christians, those under conviction of sin, and true believers—offering wise counsel to each.",Preço: 0.61,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/form/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=form&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=form&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

After noting that this subject has provoked age-long controversy among professing Christians, he assures us that “every genuine Christian 
has been
 saved, 
is now being
 saved, and 
will yet be
 saved.” Under four headings he delves into the four aspects of salvation: salvation from the pleasure of sin (regeneration), from the penalty of sin (justification), from the power of sin (sanctification), and from the presence of sin (glorification). In summary, Pink shows that God’s sovereign work of salvation spans eternity and time, stretching from election in eternity past, to justification and struggle with indwelling sin in this life, and culminating in a merciful end to the struggle as we leave this earth for our eternal home in heaven—never to see or experience sin again.",Preço: 1.10,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/fsal/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=fsal&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=fsal&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

So it follows that any man who does come will know by his very coming that he has been chosen and enabled by God’s saving grace.

 is the first volume of the four part series encompassing the breadth of Church history from its beginnings to the present day.
 
Part One:
 
When the Church Was Young AD 33-754
 focuses on the early growth of the Christian Church, developing from a small assembly of believers in Jerusalem to become a vast spiritual kingdom touching the lives of millions in many lands. Under the influence of Church Fathers and councils, carefully worded creeds guided the core doctrines of Christianity. The saints were persecuted at the hands of Jews and then Gentiles, but the Church miraculously survived to fulfill the Great Commission for its day.
 
Part Two:
 
The Church in the Middle Ages AD 754-1517 
traces the days of Charlemagne to the dawn of the Reformation. Popes and Emperors maneuvered for church power, bringing division into East and West, control by civil governments, and great wealth. The Crusades brought contact with the rich civilizations of the East. New ways of thinking swept in the Renaissance.

Part Three: The Reformation and Its Aftermath 1517-1648
 observes the tremendous upheaval when brave men were transforming the spiritual Church into conformity with God’s inerrant Word, in deliberate departure from the traditions of men. We see Luther’s increasing conviction in Germany, then Zwingli, Calvin, and Farel in Switzerland—at great personal cost. We see the spreading flame of reformation come to France, the Netherlands, Scotland, and England, including incredible struggle for supremacy between popes, monarchs, and ideas. We see the rise of different Protestant denominations as men struggled to understand the clear teachings of Scripture.
 
In 
Part Four: The Church in the Modern Age 1648-1900s
, we see the difficulty men have when given freedom to study the Scriptures, to avoid false doctrines springing out of pride and greed.

Código: gochfg,"Título: Glory of Christ, The ",Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: John Owen said, “No man shall ever behold the glory of Christ by sight in heaven who does not, in some measure, behold it by faith in this world.” Furthermore, Octavius Winslow puts it this way: “If a man sees not the glory of Christ, we hesitate not to say of him that with regard to all other spiritual objects, he is totally blind—he is yet a stranger to the illuminating grace of the Holy Spirit.” What do you think of those statements? Be honest. Do you agree with them? Or do you think them an aberration, an exaggeration…maybe a form of mysticism? Owen goes on to say, “Let no one deceive himself. He that has no sight of Christ’s glory here shall never see it hereafter.” Really? Thankfully, he explains himself: “The beholding of Christ in glory is too high, glorious, and marvelous for us in our present condition. The splendor of Christ’s glory is too much for our physical eyes just as is the sun shining in all its strength. So, while we are here on earth, we can behold His glory only by faith.” So, he is not talking about dreams or visions. Rather, he says in his famous work, 
Meditations and Discourses on the Glory of Christ, in His Person, Office, and Grace: with the Differences between Faith and Sight Applied unto the Use of Them That Believe
—or simply, 
The Glory of Christ
—that we can only see Christ’s glory in the Scriptures, preeminently in the gospel, through faith quickened by the Holy Spirit. When I first read Owen’s book, I confess that I was surprised, challenged, reproved, corrected, edified, and transformed. And, after prayer and contemplation, I realized that Owen’s point was simple, profound, and much neglected by modern Christianity. Friend, do you 
see
 the glory of Christ?
 
We read Owen in our Chapel Library staff prayer meeting, and with hearts humbled by God’s transforming truth, souls warmed with biblical glimpses of the Sun of Righteousness, affections moved by the stunning beauty of the Savior, and lives transformed by seeing Him Who loved us from all eternity, we offer you this Free Grace Broadcaster: 
The Glory of Christ. 
John Owen introduces us to this vital subject by explaining the great privilege of seeing Christ’s glory in 
this
 world as preparation for seeing His eternal splendor and majesty in the 
next
. Following this, Owen briefly explains that the glory of Christ is the glory of the 
person
 of Christ. Charles Spurgeon then helps us to glimpse that glory with a remarkable and concise panorama of Christ’s love, His incarnation, His atoning sacrifice, His resurrection, His enthronement, and His second coming! Oh, what a vision it is! Octavius Winslow then declares that there is no love like Christ’s—a revealing love, a condescending love, a self-sacrificing love, and a forgiving love. John Flavel skillfully reveals the glory of Christ in His offices as our Prophet, our Priest, and our King. Then, William Plumer gives us yet another panoramic look at Christ; but this time in His humiliation, that is, His obedient submission to His Father in His earthly life—from virgin conception to His suffering and agony on Calvary’s cross. From there, Spurgeon declares to us that Christ’s crucifixion is Christ’s glory! He presents the revelation of Christ lifted up, drawing sinners to Himself in the greatest love ever manifested in this depraved world. But Christ’s story and glory do not end there: Thomas Watson shows us that God the Father exalted His Son in His titles, His office, His ascension, His session at God’s right hand, and His judging of the world! If we really see Christ so, our hearts cannot but be ravished by His beauty; and Octavius Winslow proclaims that there is no beauty like Christ’s beauty—nothing in the universe compares! Winslow then brings this theme to a close by challenging us to 
contemplate
 Christ’s astonishing glory.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/gochfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=gochfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=gochfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: gbscfg,Título: God-breathed Scripture,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Charles Spurgeon said of the Scriptures, “This volume is the writing of the living God: each letter was penned with an Almighty finger; each word in it dropped from the everlasting lips, each sentence was dictated by the Holy Spirit.” This was once 
the
 bedrock doctrine of biblical Christianity. It lay at the heart of the Protestant Reformation, which many are remembering this year. That extraordinary event was not merely about the correct view of justification, the true worship of God, or the reformation of marriage and family. Underlying all this was the most important question for all people at all times to answer: “What is our final authority?” Without an authoritative revelation from God, we have no object for our faith. The inspired, infallible Word of God is our final authority for all of life. As stated in the Second London Baptist Confession of 1689, “The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience” (1.1).
 
Unfortunately, few professing Christians believe this anymore. So, with this thought, we present the first FGB of 2017: 
God-breathed Scripture
. Arthur W. Pink introduces this vital subject with thoughts on the impregnable rock of Scripture and its divine inspiration. Louis Gaussen then helps us understand what “inspiration” really means. In a day when poets and musicians are considered to offer “inspired” performances, we need a clear grasp of this mysterious act of God. What then is 
verbal
 inspiration? David Martyn Lloyd-Jones explains this important doctrine, which many professing Christians have abandoned. Thomas Boston then gives a concise description of the contents of the canon of Scripture and tells us how the Apocrypha relates to it. Charles Hodge gives insight into the infallibility and authority of God’s words, while Benjamin B. Warfield reveals that Jesus believed and taught that the Scriptures were God-breathed and authoritative. And then a question: which has ultimate authority—a religious organization or Scripture? Wilhelmus à Brakel answers this, and lists divine characteristics that prove the Bible authoritative. Octavius Winslow agrees that creation reveals the existence of God, but only the Bible tells us how God saves through the person and work of Jesus Christ. In a second article, Thomas Boston acknowledges that Scripture is not always easy to understand, yet everything sinners need to know for the salvation of their eternal souls 
is
 clear. Though the Bible gives abundant evidence of its divine origin, why does anyone truly believe it is God’s Word? John Murray answers, “The witness of the Holy Spirit in the human heart.” Finally, Charles Spurgeon reaffirms that, in Scripture, God speaks; and for that very reason, we should give our earnest attention to every word of it.
 
As we begin this new year, our hearts’ desire is to encourage you to love, believe, obey, and commune with the Living God through His inspired Word.

 God. Referring to a popular but false view of God, he affirms that God is

Código: gepufg,Título: God's Eternal Purpose,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: In his classic work, 
The Economy of the Covenants between God and Man, 
Herman Witsius (1636-1708) made the following statement: “The covenant between the Father and the Son is the foundation of the whole of our salvation.” ...Do we realize that everything Christ did in history was planned in eternity?
 
So, what do we call this “eternal purpose”? ...The Word of God says that the unsearchable riches of God’s grace and His manifold wisdom are displayed, “according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Eph 3:11). This and many other passages are why Witsius and others believed then and still believe today that an eternal agreement between the Father and Son is plainly set forth in the infallible Word of God. For instance: “This is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing” (Joh 6:39).
 
To encourage God’s people to think deeply about these matters, we present this issue of the FGB, 
God’s Eternal Purpose...
David Martyn Lloyd-Jones introduces this deeply profound subject. Charles Spurgeon then beautifully, movingly explains the parties, stipulations, and objects of God’s eternal counsels. What is the nature of this eternal agreement? Patrick Gillespie describes it, and Peter Bulkeley offers a brief list of the promises and agreements exchanged between the Father and the Son in eternity. The biblical reality of God’s plan is explored by R. B. C. Howell, and A. W. Pink shows the importance of Christ’s election as our Mediator. Now, is this all speculation, or is there any practical value to the contemplation of this subject? Thomas Brooks answers that question with a detailed exposition of the agreements between Father and Son, aimed at the edification and encouragement of believers. A. A. Hodge helps us to see that the only way to understand Christ’s atonement properly is through the lens of God’s eternal purpose. And then, Spurgeon, in a second article, gives us a breathtaking vision of the consummation of God’s plan—the marriage of the Lamb. Finally, Isaac Ambrose urges us to a deep love for Christ because He planned and agreed to be our Savior before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah!

Código: glovfg,Título: God's Love,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: In the hope of doing some good to God’s eternally-loved children, we present this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster: 
God’s Love
. Octavius Winslow, a man whose writings are steeped in the love of God, introduces us to God’s glorious attribute of love. Arthur Pink then reveals the extraordinary nature of God’s infinite love for His people. Puritan Thomas Manton shows us that first God loved His eternal Son in eternity, then, He loved His people in Christ, and now He loves Christ in His people. Do we have a good grasp of how that love comes from eternity into history? Thomas Reade helps us to see this in Christ Jesus. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones shows us that God manifests His love in many ways; but the clearest, highest, and most beautiful way is in the person and work of Jesus Christ our Lord. How does a Christian live in this world of sorrow, heartaches, troubles, and misery? In a second article, Winslow tells us that we should trust God’s love for us in every providence. Samuel Eyles Pierce wants us to ponder deeply the Apostle John’s command to 
behold 
the wonderful love God had for us in eternity, has for us now, and will have forever. Few people can preach about God’s love with the authority, tenderness, and clarity of Charles Spurgeon. He sets before us God’s immeasurable love in His eternally loved Son for His eternally loved people. And Winslow has the final word: having given a biblical exposition of God’s mighty love in Christ, in this last article, he soberly tells what happens when God’s love turns to anger.
 
Drink in what the Scriptures truly teach about God and His love in the words of these faithful preachers. Gaze upon the love that is so high, so wide, so deep that it transforms the human soul forever.

, Horatius Bonar gives a clear understanding of the gospel as proclaimed by Christ and the apostles, while correcting some of the distortions that can destroy its message and confuse the seeking soul.

Código: gwmw,"Título: God's Will, Man's Will, and Free Will",Autor: Ernest C. Reisinger,"Descrição: From the Introduction:
 “Does salvation depend upon man’s willingness to be saved apart from a prior work of the Holy Spirit? We will see that no one is saved against his will; however, God changes the “willer” so as to make the sinner willing. We will see that the subject of free will is at the very heart of Christianity and has a profound effect on our message and method of evangelism. We will see that “whosoever will may come.” We will see that the Bible teaches that salvation depends not on man’s willingness but on God’s willingness, God’s grace, and God’s power—and if God did not have power over man’s will the whole world would go to hell. We will see that God does not exclude anyone in His invitations; however, sinners do exclude themselves.”

Introducing the theme of this booklet, Pastor Lee Roy Shelton states: “I believe that one of the grave errors of our day is the preaching of the love of God at the expense of His wrath and justice.” He develops this theme in four sections including: an explanation of God’s wrath as one of His divine attributes, a description of eternal punishment as the destiny of the wicked, a discussion of why God must punish sin, and what Christ says about God’s wrath. Shelton concludes with a description of the unbeliever’s perilous condition—he is condemned already, God’s sword is ready to come down at any moment, and God has made no promise to stay His hand.

Código: gog5,"Título: Goodness of God, The",Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: A. W. Pink has loaded this uplifting tract with numerous insights into the goodness of God. Below are a few highlights to whet the reader’s appetite.
 
 
 
The goodness of God refers to the perfection of His nature.
 
He is originally good, good of Himself, and the highest good.
 
All that emanates from God—His decrees, creation, laws, and providence—cannot be anything but good.
 
His goodness is seen in that when man first sinned, a dispensation of unmixed wrath did not immediately begin.
 
God’s goodness appeared most brightly when He sent forth His Son for the salvation of His people.
 
Gratitude is the return justly required from the recipients of His benefits.
 
The goodness of God is the life of the believer’s trust.

Fourth, while the gospel is a “proclamation of pardon addressed to sinners without exception…it is the power of God unto salvation only to those who believe,” whose hearts are purified by faith. Fifth, he warns that all who claim to be saved, but do not live soberly and righteously in this present world, and show no fruit, prove their salvation is a delusion.",Preço: 0.09,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/gwii/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=gwii&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

First it is eternal—planned and purposed in eternity before it is imparted in time. Second it is free, for nothing could ever purchase it. Third it is sovereign, because God bestows it upon whom He pleases. Furthermore, all three Persons of the Trinity are involved: God the Father is the Fountain of all grace, God the Son is the only Channel, and the Holy Spirit is the Bestower.

Código: gjud,"Título: Great Judgment, The",Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon,"Descrição: The final judgment is a foundational doctrine of Christianity, and one of the most solemn. In this booklet, Charles Spurgeon sheds scriptural light on several of its aspects. Introducing his subject, he shows that the great judgment follows immediately after the resurrection of the dead so that they may be judged in their bodies. He goes on to indicate in the first place that no one escapes this final accounting, for every person who has ever lived will be judged; secondly, that the judge is none other than Jesus Christ Himself; thirdly, that the basis of judgment consists of those things done in the body; and finally, he describes the outcome—“the Lord will grant unto His people an abundant reward for all that they have done” and unto the ungodly the eternal punishment due to their sinful deeds. Spurgeon is quick to point out that the righteous do not deserve any reward, but that “God first gave them grace to do good works, then took their good works as evidence of a renewed heart, and then gave them a reward for what they had done.” He sums it all up this way, “…sin is hell and holiness is heaven.” And ends with an impassioned plea, “Oh, that we may have grace, every one of us, to flee to Christ. There is our only safety.”",Preço: 0.61,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/gjud/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=gjud&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=gjud&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Second, trouble can be sent by God for benefits besides reproof of sin—for example, His purpose can be to make His people more like Christ, or fit them for greater usefulness in Christian service.

For example, those who reject Christ do so because of blindness of heart, self-righteousness, worldliness of mind, or unbelief. In addition, he explores the motives of those who falsely profess a heavenly birth under three headings taken from John 1:13—born of blood, born of the will of the flesh, and born of the will of man.

Indeed, they that will have heaven must run for it. “They which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize…so run, that ye may obtain” (1Co 9:24). He understands that most are too casual in their approach to the Christian life. Their vigilance looks more like sloth too much of the time! Instead, Bunyan encourages us to “press toward the mark,” to “continue in the faith” in spite of all adversity, to remove hindrances, to beware of by-paths, to know the cross and mortification, to deny self, and to persevere.

Philpot first addresses the spiritual exercises distinct to the people of God, followed by the special deliverances of God to His people. He then remarks on the special external marks of believers, in which, ""They will be separate from the world."" In his closing words, he observes ""the marks visible to the Church of God"", the marks of true and saving salvation in Christ by which these souls are found to be ""His Own Special People.""",Preço: 0.52,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/hosp/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=hosp&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=hosp&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: hol2,Título: Holiness,Autor: Joel Beeke,"Descrição: Holiness
 – 
from the Introduction
: “There is a simple yet profound word which occurs nine hundred times in the Bible. You see it first in Genesis, as we are informed how God created heaven and earth. You see it last in the Bible's final chapter, where we are told about God's creation of a new heaven and a new earth. One entire book, Leviticus, is devoted to the subject of this word. Yet this word is strangely overlooked today. Though it describes the uniqueness of God and the calling of all His children, it is largely ignored. This short yet awesome word is 
holy. 
Among other words, 
saint, sanctify, 
and 
sanctification 
are obtained from its root. What does 
holy, holiness 
mean? What is the scriptural 
call to holiness? 
How must holiness be 
practiced? 
Why does the church so desperately need holiness in our day?” Joel Beeke effectively answers these questions, using the Scriptures as authority and guide.",Preço: 0.69,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/hol2/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=hol2&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=hol2&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: hahu,Título: Holiness and Humility,Autor: Andrew Murray,"Descrição: In this tract, Andrew Murray explains how we can determine if the holiness we profess or seek is genuine. He gives his conclusion in the first paragraph. “The one infallible test of our holiness will be the humility before God and men that marks us. Humility is the bloom and the beauty of holiness.” On the other hand, “The chief mark of counterfeit holiness is its lack of humility.” Murray goes on to illustrate the point using the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector. Finally, he warns all who seek or teach holiness that “There is no pride so dangerous, because none is so subtle or insidious, as the pride of holiness.” He ends with this plea, “Come let us flee to Jesus, and hide ourselves in Him until we be clothed upon with His humility. That alone is our holiness.”",Preço: 0.09,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/hahu/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=hahu&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

The departing from the faith has come as a consequence for not believing the Word of God is the “voice of the Lord your God” (Deu 8:20). Jesus said of these times that “because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold” (Mat 24:12). The coldness is a lack of real love for His Word, lacking any serious desire to obey it and to be conformed by it. Many claim to passionately ‘love the Lord,’ but without a manifest love for what He says. This effort is not to propose that I have the last word on music, but to take it out of the darkness of subjective reasonings and traditions of men, and place it in the light of the Word of God.—

Pink examines the following aspects of the Holy Spirit’s work in salvation: regenerating, quickening, enlightening, convicting, comforting, drawing, and working faith. His biblical insights regarding the first (regeneration) and the last (faith) are particularly valuable today because these two areas are frequently misunderstood by modern evangelicals. Regeneration, for example, is believed by many to be the 
result
 of one’s “decision for Christ.” But as Pink shows, regeneration 
precedes
 repentance and belief. Likewise—and also unlike what many believe today—faith is not something that can be produced at will, but is a gift of God given by the Holy Spirit.

He also repudiates the assertion that Spurgeon, and those like him, teach that God drags men to Christ against their will. But since all men are naturally resistant, how does the Father draw them? According to Spurgeon, He sends the Holy Spirit to change men’s hearts so that they come willingly to the Savior without any compulsion whatever. How is this accomplished?

will not
 come to Christ because he chooses only according to his nature that has, since the fall, “become…debased, depraved, and corrupt.” At the same time, natural man 
cannot
 come to Christ because he is dead in trespasses and sins (Eph 2:1).

Horatius Bonar provides a biblical examination and description of God's way of reckoning righteousness to those who believe. In the third article, John Calvin explains that we must look outside ourselves for the righteousness that God accepts. Charles Hodge gives a detailed study of the imputation of Christ's righteousness, defining the terms, proving the doctrine and examining apostolic arguments. Ebenezer Erksine follows with a brief overview of Adam's fall in the Garden and Christ's deliverance by obtaining righteousness for His people. In his second article, Bonar considers some objections to the doctrine of Christ's substitutionary work and imputed righteousness.

Código: incafg,Título: Incarnation,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: To help us all think better about this “most extraordinary and amazing affair,” we present this issue of the FGB, 
Incarnation
. To introduce the subject, J. C. Ryle gives a helpful, clear, and biblical explanation of the fundamentals of Christ’s incarnation. John Flavel then gives us an extraordinary glimpse of Christ’s pre-incarnate glory—the glory and relationship of love that He had with His heavenly Father before the world began. Far too many Christians in our day think only of the Incarnation in terms of the babe in the manger, without relating it to God’s eternal purpose—His counsels and decrees; A. W. Pink helps us to overcome that shortsightedness. While we are on the subject of the pre-incarnate Christ, Lorraine Boettner gives us a useful survey of certain passages that point to Christ’s existence before time: Jesus made abundantly clear that His existence did not simply begin when He was born in Bethlehem. And Bethlehem—“little among the thousands of Judah”—was the very spot on which God’s eternal purpose of redemption became an historical reality. Horatius Bonar tells us, “At Bethlehem, our world’s history begins”—do we believe that? Thomas Boston helps us to understand the birth of Christ—the virgin conception, the sanctification of Christ’s human nature, the union of manhood and Godhead in the person of Christ, and 
why 
Jesus had to be born of a virgin. The glorious doctrine of the Incarnation then unfolds with William S. Plumer, as he describes the greatest event that ever happened—God became man. With a second article, John Flavel explains the necessary humiliation of God’s eternal Son—its nature, degrees, and duration—showing us that Christ had to be greatly humbled before He was highly exalted. Charles Spurgeon gives us the last word: He explains that in the God-man, we may see all the attributes of God. But he would have us focus on 
this
 glorious display: Jesus was full of grace and truth!

The one gift is “the unspeakable gift” where God spared not his Son so he could spare us. While the gift is one, it is infinite, the gift of all gifts. Furthermore, this one gift was given not for righteous men, but for sinners whose portion was condemnation. So the question comes—if God Is willing to give the ultimate gift to such as us, will He deny us any other needful thing? Clearly, the answer is no.

Jesus pays the debt and God forgives the sins of those who believe.

 But the essay is much more; it is a direct refutation of what has become a watered-down man-centered gospel, and a step in the recovery of the God-centered Gospel contained in the Scriptures. There is no doubt that Evangelicalism today is in a state of perplexity and unsettlement. In such matters as the practice of evangelism, the teaching of holiness, the building up of local church life, the pastor’s dealing with souls and the exercise of discipline, there is evidence of widespread dissatisfaction with things as they are and of equally widespread uncertainty as to the road ahead. Without realizing it, we have during the past century bartered that Gospel for a substitute product which, though it looks similar enough in points of detail, is as a whole a decidedly different thing.

The second, and less commonly understood, is that we receive the righteousness of Christ based on His perfect obedience to the law. Spurgeon describes it this way, “We therefore assert, believing that Scripture fully warrants us, that the life of Christ constitutes the righteousness in which His people are to be clothed. His death washed away their sins, His life covered them from head to foot; His death was the sacrifice to God, His life was the gift to man, by which man satisfies the demands of the law.”",Preço: 0.52,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/jcor/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=jcor&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=jcor&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

He explores the contrast between law and grace under three headings: the entrance of the law into the world, its entrance into the heart, and the extent that grace excels sin. According to Romans 5:20, God sent the law that “offence might abound.” But how does this happen? In the world, the law sheds additional light on sin, removing all excuses. In the heart, it reveals the total depravity of our nature and our sentence of condemnation—leaving no room for doubt that we are powerless to save ourselves. Finally, Spurgeon demonstrates that grace greatly excels sin in both measure and efficacy.

He demonstrates by reflecting on historical revivals that true revival is not only possible in our day, but should be sought after and anticipated by the people of God everywhere.",Preço: 1.10,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/lpfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=lpfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=lpfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: losr,Título: Letters of Samuel Rutherford,Autor: Samuel Rutherford,"Descrição: Like John Bunyan in the Bedford jail, Samuel Rutherford did his best work while suffering imprisonment for the Gospel. His opponents had meant to silence him, but instead they perpetuated his ministry through the centuries: it was out of this period that most of his famous Letters came. Addressed to high and low, they were so prized by the recipients that the first collection by Robert McWard appeared in 1664, just three years after Rutherford’s death. The successive editions contained more letters until they grew to the 365 in Andrew Bonar’s classic edition.
 
From this, “the most remarkable series of devotional letters that the literature of the Reformed churches can show,” the great leaders in the church as well as the humblest Christians have drawn strength. It is said of Robert Murray McCheyne that “the 
Letters of Samuel Rutherford
 were often in his hand.” Richard Baxter’s view was that, apart from the Bible, “such a book as Mr. Rutherford’s 
Letters
 the world never saw the like,” while to C.H. Spurgeon they were “the nearest think to inspiration which can be found in all the writings of mere men.” This abridged edition contains thirty of these letters.
 
“You have heard of my trouble, I suppose. It hath pleased our sweet Lord Jesus to let loose the malice of these interdicted lords in his house to deprive me of my ministry at Anwoth, and to confine me, eight score miles from thence, to Aberdeen; and also (which was not done to any before) to inhibit me to speak at all in Jesus’ name within this kingdom, under the pain of rebellion. The cause that ripened their hatred was my book, whereof they accused me on those three days I appeared before them. But let our crowned King in Zion reign! By his grace the loss is theirs, the advantage is Christ’s and truth’s.”—
Samuel Rutherford in a letter to Robert Cunningham, 1636.",Preço: 1.92,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/losr/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=losr&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=losr&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

The Sword and Trowel
, it is well-written and perfect for those who would like a brief overview of Calvin’s life that nevertheless hits all the important high points. Calvin arrived in Paris in 1521 at the age of twelve to study for the priesthood. He struggled when confronted with the true gospel, was eventually converted, and ultimately forced to flee his native country because of Catholic persecution. In due course, he settled in Geneva where he pursued a many-faceted ministry through periods of both opposition (including banishment) and support from the local authorities. All the while, he labored over his most famous theological work, the 
Institutes of the Christian Religion
, revising it several times. Calvin died in 1564, leaving a remarkable legacy as “evangelist, pastor, reformer, theologian, and The Prince of Expositors.”",Preço: 0.69,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/loca/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=loca&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=loca&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: loml,Título: Life of Martin Luther,Autor: Joel Beeke,"Descrição: Life of Martin Luther
 by Diana Kleyn and Joel Beeke is a concise summary of Luther’s significant life and contribution to evangelical Christianity. His conscientious search for the truth of salvation through diligent study of the Bible led to the recovery of the biblical doctrine of justification by faith alone. His advocacy for reform in the Roman Catholic Church led to the Protestant Reformation, which spread throughout Germany, France, The Netherlands, Scotland, Sweden, and England, and became a major influence upon which Western culture is formed. Every Christian should be familiar with his life, and give thanks to God for raising him up for such an important time as the Reformation.

Not praying for others. While we often pray for ourselves, our family, and our church, we neglect to pray for the Lord’s servants, missionaries, and all who are in authority.
 
Respect of persons or pleasing man rather than God. This sin is all too common in the churches today and takes many forms—for example, catering to the rich and educated members rather than the poor and uneducated.

Código: lbco,Título: London Baptist Confession of Faith - 1689,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: The London Baptist Confession of 1677/89
 played an important role in Baptist history. The Act of Uniformity of 1662 made the new Anglican Prayer Book mandatory for use in all Anglican, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Baptist churches in England. Moreover, the Anglican church abandoned the Westminster Confession and returned to the Thirty-Nine Articles as its official confession of faith. Consequently, with the restoration of the Monarchy, the English Baptists suffered persecution for their faith. In 1677, a group of Particular Baptists met for the purpose of producing a more expansive confession than the previous Baptist confession of 1644. They modeled the Second London Confession on the Westminster Confession, but with significant theological differences regarding church government and baptism. Persecution kept the 1677 document from being officially endorsed by Particular Baptists until 1689, when the Toleration Act was passed. This act enabled religious freedom to co-exist alongside the established churches in England and Scotland. As a result, representatives from over 100 Particular Baptist churches met in London from July 3-11 to discuss and endorse the 1677 document. Though the confession was published in 1677, the General Assembly of Particular Baptist Churches adopted it in 1689; hence it is commonly known as “the 1689.” The Westminster Confession, the Savoy Declaration, and the London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 are considered the most important Reformed confessions arising from the English-speaking world.

Código: ldayfg,"Título: Lord's Day, The",Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: For those who have a new heart, the Lord's Day truly is “a market-day of the soul.” With this in mind, this third Free Grace Broadcaster of 2015 is entitled 
The Lord’s Day. 
That great day is—at least it should be—a taste of glory divine and of the eternal rest that awaits all of God’s elect. What a blessing it is that God has ordered things so that once a week, after every six days of work, we have a day given to Him—one seventh of our time gloriously spent with the One Who loved us and gave Himself for us!
 
This issue begins with Arthur W. Pink, who gives us a glimpse of the origin of the six-days-of-work and one-day-of-rest pattern that God established in His almighty work of creation. J. C. Ryle offers a multitude of Scriptures from the Old and New Testaments that lay the groundwork for the seventh-day Sabbath and the first-day-of-the-week Lord’s Day. Thomas Boston gives a brief exposition of the Fourth Commandment, while Benjamin B. Warfield lays a biblical foundation for observing the Lord’s Day. Why do Christians worship on Sunday instead of Saturday? Archibald A. Hodge helps us to understand the biblical and historical shift from Sabbath to Lord’s Day. Ezekiel Hopkins then gives us a brief glimpse of how we worship on the Lord’s Day in 
public
, while William S. Plumer teaches us that our Lord’s Day responsibilities reach into the 
home
. Apart from worship in public and at home, what kind of works should we do on the Lord’s Day? Ezekiel Hopkins explains works of piety, necessity, and charity. Thomas Case wisely counsels us in honoring the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit on the day of worship. And, finally, Jonathan Edwards makes clear that the Lord’s Day was not given to us to be a burden, but a time of most precious enjoyment—truly a market-day of the soul.
 
Our earnest prayer is that the Lord Jesus, Who died upon Calvary’s cross and rose again the third day, will fill all His children’s hearts with an earnest, honest, and Spirit-wrought love for His Day. Parents and grandparents, we urge you to meditate upon this and teach it to your children and grandchildren. Pastors and teachers, we urge you to preach on this much-neglected subject.

 gives detailed explanation of Romans 1:16-32 to show the depth of man’s sin and the downward spiral in which he finds himself, ending in eternal separation from God. The last chapters focus on the living hope we have in Christ, the perfect unmerited Substitute provided by God in His love for us. We see that God’s righteous justice require penalty for sin, that man is incapable of paying for it himself apart from his own death, that a perfect Substitute was provided in Christ at the cross, that man must have holiness in order to stand before God, and that this holiness is found only in Christ.",Preço: 4.43,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/mrgr/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mrgr&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mrgr&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

He notes at the very beginning that, “A proper understanding of the content of the gospel and the use of God-honoring methods in evangelism are dependent on one’s grasp of this issue.” Using Matthew 12:33-37, in easy-to-understand terms Chantry carefully lays out the case under four headings: 1) man’s will has a certain freedom, 2) man’s will is not sovereign, 3) man’s will is in bondage to sin, and 4) man’s will is not his hope. He ends by pointing to man’s only real hope. “While we address the wills of men in gospel preaching, they are wills bound in the grave clothes of an evil heart. But as we speak, and the Lord owns His word, sinners are quickened to life by divine power.”",Preço: 0.43,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/mwfy/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mwfy&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Jonathan Dickinson answers this question with penetrating care. He reminds us that there is a form of repentance and faith that falls far short of salvation. Evangelical repentance shows itself in mourning over sin, love for God and His Law, and trust in His mercy. It is a daily exercise and results in a total change of life. Saving faith includes a sensible impression of gospel truth, an embrace of the terms of the gospel, a humble trust in Christ alone, submission to His Lordship, love to God and men, and real heart humility.",Preço: 0.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/motr/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=motr&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=motr&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

While seeking to be a blessing to others the servant of Christ must attend to the reality of his own walk with Christ and the uprightness of his own character.  It is an echo of  Paul’s concern that when he had preached to others, he himself should not be disqualified. 
 
“The solemn work with which the Christian ministry concerns itself demands a man’s all, and that all at its best. To engage in it half-heartedly is an insult to God and man. Slumber must forsake our eyelids sooner than men shall be allowed to perish. Yet we, are all prone to sleep as do others...therefore have I sought to speak out my whole soul, in the hope that I might not create or foster dullness in others. May He in whose hand are the churches and their pastors bless these words...and if so I shall count it more than a full reward, and shall gratefully praise the Lord.”

Código: mortfg,Título: Mortification,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Do we understand what it means to ""mortify our members which are upon the earth"" (Col 3:5)? A. W. Pink states, ""No progress can be made by you in the Christian life, until you realize the paramount importance and imperative necessity of waging a ceaseless warfare against indwelling sin."" John Owen tells us, ""The choicest believers, who are assuredly freed from the condemning power of sin, ought yet to make it their business all their days to mortify the indwelling power of sin."" This is clear from Paul's statement in Romans: ""For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live"" (Rom 8:13). 
 
So, what 
is 
mortification, and why is it important? What place does it have in our walk with Christ? These are some of the questions dealt with in this issue of the 
Free Grace Broadcaster.
 
Our opening article by Arthur Pink introduces us to the doctrine of mortification. John Flavel follows by explaining what mortification is not and what it is. Benjamin Needler then teaches us how to search out and identify beloved lusts. Only Christians can truly mortify sin: this is the point of Horatius Bonar's article. John Owen, who wrote a penetrating, helpful book on this subject, gives us clear directions on how to mortify sin. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones shows us that we cannot accomplish this without the power of the Holy Spirit. Many great perils attend our neglect of mortification; Ezekiel Hopkins, who also wrote an important work on this, warns us of them. Ralph Erskine helps us discern the difference between legal and gospel mortification. Finally, Christopher Love explains how we may determine if we are in a state of mortification or not. May this issue of the Broadcaster encourage and help us all in this holy war against sin, which we will fight until we see Christ in all His glory!",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/mortfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mortfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mortfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: mothfg,Título: Motherhood,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: In the early 1600s, a young English woman, Elizabeth Brooke Joscelin, wrote an important letter. She was pregnant and concerned that she might not live to bring up her child. She began her touching letter by addressing her husband: “To my truly loving and most dearly loved husband, Tourell Joscelin: Mine own dear love, I no sooner conceived a hope that I should be made a mother by thee, but with it entered the consideration of a mother’s duty; and shortly after followed the apprehension of danger that might prevent me from executing that care I so exceedingly desired: I mean in Christian training our child.” Throughout her letter, her burning love for her husband, her child, and her Savior shines brightly. She was
 delighted 
with this thought: “that I should be made a mother by thee.” She 
wanted
 to bear children with her husband. Nevertheless, her heart’s desire was not simply to bear children—even non-Christian women sometimes desire this. Her longing for a child was biblically focused on “that care I so exceedingly desired: I mean in Christian training our child.” She wanted to bear and bring up children for the Lord Jesus Christ. Bearing children in her day carried with it a high mortality rate for mother and child. Elizabeth was deeply concerned that she might die without the privilege of teaching her son or daughter about Christ and how to live for Him. How did she calm her realistic fears? She could have avoided this fear altogether by simply practicing birth control or by seeking an abortion (which was available then, though not as readily). But she found her comfort in God’s Word: “These fears were cured with the remembrance that all things work together for the best to those that love God (Rom 8:28) and a certain assurance that He will give me patience according to my pain.”
 
Strengthened with biblical truth, she then wrote an astonishing letter to her unborn child, filled with instructions, biblical thought, and earnest exhortations for how to start, spend, and end the day to God’s glory. It was her Christian legacy to her unborn baby. She wrote detailed warnings, exhortations, and promises about everything from seeking God while a child, to starting and ending the day in prayer, to pursuing humility and modesty in apparel, to studying theology! She concluded the address to her beloved Tourell, “I hope God will so give me His grace that I shall more skillfully 
act
 than apprehend a mother’s duty… Thus, humbly desiring God to give thee all comfort in this life and happiness in the life to come, I leave thee and thine to His most gracious protection.” On October 12, 1622, she gave birth to Theodora. Nine days later, Elizabeth Joscelin died. She was twenty-seven years old.
 
To read Elizabeth’s letter is to step into a different world of motherhood than our own. Her legacy to her unborn child brims with biblical references; in fact, her very thinking seems to be saturated with Proverbs 31, Titus 2, and biblical womanhood. While she never had the pleasure of bringing up Theodora for Christ, her mother’s heart bares itself with astonishing beauty in her humble, but firm exhortations. Her burning desire to bear this child—fully knowing the risk—and her greater desire to bring up this son or daughter for Christ is the very essence of biblical motherhood.
 
For this reason, the theme of this Free Grace Broadcaster is 
Motherhood
, a complement to last quarter’s 
Fatherhood
. Jabez Burns introduces us to the dignity of motherhood, something often lost to our culture. Thomas Boston briefly explores a mother’s main responsibility—a subject quite foreign to our post-Christian worldview. Peter Marshall develops something of a modern parable to show us our desperate need for a return to biblical motherhood. An almost forgotten Scottish Congregationalist named James Cameron gives us three articles—biblically training children, encouraging mothers, and calling mothers to Christ.

From what is the will free? What is its power? Chantry goes on to examine three myths regarding man’s will. In the myth of circumstantial freedom, he points out that one has the ability to make a decision, but not the power to carry out its purpose. In the myth of ethical freedom, he shows that the will of man is free from outside force, but not from the bias of human nature. And that bias is against God. Finally, in the myth of spiritual freedom, Chantry states that because man is at enmity with his Creator, his whole being hates God, His truth, and His rule.

He first points out the obvious: that those who hold infidel principles and who live in a total disregard of religious ordinances, despise the salvation of God. But there are others that, while they do not despise God’s salvation, are simply “neglecters of salvation.”
 
According to Reade, this neglect can take three forms:
 
 
Living in the allowed indulgence of one known sin.
 
Building on any other foundation than Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
 
Preferring an earthly object rather than Jesus Christ.

Spurgeon,"Descrição: The biblical remedy for pragmatism; a sermon preached by Charles Spurgeon in the context of the ""Downgrade Controversy,"" the controversy surrounding the liberal views of Scripture creeping into the Baptist union of the time. Spurgeon takes Genesis 24 about Abraham's servant seeking a wife for Isaac, and reminds us that there is no room for compromise when we are on the errand of the King.

He asks personally and pointedly, “Are not the probabilities dead against you ever being saved?” And then he pleads with such a one, “Now, now, now, believe and live.”",Preço: 0.05,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/nsav/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=nsav&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: obedfg,Título: Obedience,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: In our day, modern American religion has such a flimsy, worldly, and perverted view of grace, one is not surprised that many professing believers think they are hearing the unbearable clanking of legalistic chains when some preacher is witless enough—or maybe even has the Christlike love for their souls enough—to tell them that the Word of God commands them obey the Lord Jesus Christ. The truth of the matter is that Jesus Himself says that obeying Him is our expression of love for Him; in fact, He goes on to say that we positively do not love Him if we do not obey Him. This is sobering, but biblical truth.
 
With this is mind, we present the latest Free Grace Broadcaster: 
Obedience
.
 
Pastors—when was the last time you taught Christ's blood-bought people the importance of obedience to Christ? Parents—does your life of obedience to Christ fill your home, your family worship, your daily lives with the fragrance of Christ's grace? How we pray that this issue of the FGB will stir your heart to love Christ Jesus by keeping His commandments! His precious blood, spilled on Calvary's cross, not only cleanses us, but sanctifies as well. May our hearts pour out our love to Christ by fervent, humble, joyful obedience to Him. Obey is a four-letter word that blood-bought believers should love.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/obedfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=obedfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=obedfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Pink considers the truth of Jesus’ words in John 6:44 “No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him.” He goes on to point out that the reason this is such a “hard saying,” even to many professing Christians, is that they fail to realize the terrible havoc which the Fall has wrought. According to Pink, the inability of natural man does not spring from any physical or mental defect, but from the utter devastation which the Fall inflicted in four areas—man’s corrupt nature, the complete darkness of his understanding, the complete corruption of his affections (that is, what he loves), and the total perversity of his will.

First, one must have been regenerated and possess eternal life. Second, those who walk with God meet much opposition “for they will oppose the course of this world.” Third, they have the seal of adoption as sons and daughters of God the Father, the sovereign Ruler over heaven and earth. Fourth, they love God supremely and “cannot be satisfied without the friendship of God.” James ends with this lively encouragement: “As beggars dressed in the robes of God’s righteousness, we forget the trials of this lower land and soar and sing of Him Who ever loved us and made choice of us.”",Preço: 0.14,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/owwg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=owwg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

This is crucial because it is God's grace through the Holy Spirit that begins and carries on the work. On the other hand, without the Spirit the work of men is futile. It will never produce true revival, for ""the Spirit is the Author of regeneration and sanctification"" — and both are necessary hallmarks of true revival. Finally, while we pray we must also work, because the ""children of the wicked one will not come to the light; it must be carried to them."" In the end, Alexander notes, ""Every great awakening has proceeded from the Holy Spirit. Therefore pray for the Spirit.""",Preço: 0.14,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/pfts/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=pfts&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: pra2,Título: Prayer,Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: Based on Mark 11:24 and speaking directly to believers, A. W. Pink points out and elaborates on three things that are necessary for effective prayer. First, make sure that you are asking for something that is in accordance with God’s revealed will, which is found in His Word. Second, having made sure that your prayer is in God's will, plead the promises which are also in His Word. Plead them in the name of Christ that He may be honored and that you may be helped in godly living. Third, expect God to do as you have asked. According to Pink, “If your requests are for God’s glory and your (real) good, be assured that they shall be granted.” Finally, he urges us never to forget that we have a Friend in the Court of Heaven—Jesus Christ our Savior and Advocate.",Preço: 0.06,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/pra2/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=pra2&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

First, the circumstances of this prayer serve to instruct us.
 The rich man prayed when he saw the kingdom of God; he prayed earnestly from a sense of need and in great agony, but he prayed too late.
 
Second, the petitions of this prayer are intended for our correction.
 He prayed to the wrong person, asked for the wrong deliverer, and sought the wrong water.
 
Third, the mocking response to this prayer is for our solemn warning. 
Abraham called him “son,” asked him “to remember,” and “to consider what he has missed.” Finally, he is told that hell is forever.

Answering this vital question, Ralph Erskine asserts that rather than trusting in themselves, Christian are to glorify God in a spirit of ""faith and humiliation"" which relies upon Christ as the source of strength. In this spirit of faith and humiliation, God is glorified by the service of His people to Him; which is a demonstration that it is their ""principal honour and happiness to be employed in his service, and so a proclaiming that he is a good and bountiful Master.

We are brought into fellowship with the sufferings of Christ;
 
There is a vast disproportion between our present sufferings and future glory;
 
Our very sufferings provide for the development of hope and patience;

The Greek word “gehenna,” however, clearly does mean hell. Along with other chilling descriptions, Jesus repeatedly used this term to warn of eternal punishment for those who remain unrepentant. Despite some modern day denials, Scripture unequivocally describes hell as a place of physical, unquenchable fire which lasts forever and ever.

“Remember Lot’s wife.” According to J. C. Ryle, there are few warnings in Scripture more solemn than this. It is solemn because of the person Jesus names—not a godly person like Abraham, or Hannah, or Ruth, but one whose soul was lost forever. As Lot’s wife, she was part of Abraham’s family and thus enjoyed the greatest exposure to true salvation in her time. But Ryle asks, “Yet what good effect had all these privileges on the heart of Lot’s wife? None at all. She lived and died graceless, godless, impenitent, and unbelieving.” This teaches us that privileges alone are not what men need; they need the grace of the Holy Ghost. Ryle ends by asking a pointed question, “Have you yet received the Holy Ghost? If not, you are no better than Lot’s wife.”",Preço: 0.09,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/rlwi/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=rlwi&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: rlvt,Título: Repentance--Legal vs. True,Autor: James Heard,"Descrição: According to James Heard, true repentance and true faith are products of regeneration by the Holy Spirit. He notes that there is also a false (or legal) repentance. This repentance arises from a fear of punishment, but is not accompanied by hatred of sin and self. So what does true repentance look like? It is a gift of God wrought in the heart so that a sinner is humbled by godly sorrow and abhors himself and his sin, crying out for forgiveness. It consists of three elements—a change of mind, a change of feeling, and a change of purpose. Heard uses the story of the prodigal son to illustrate these and then quotes Acts 3:19 to show the glorious results of repentance, “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out…”",Preço: 0.09,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/rlvt/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=rlvt&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: resufg,Título: Resurrection,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Some of us seem to have let the resurrection drift to a very distant—perhaps for some, a non-existent—place in our preaching. Where this is so, it is entirely out of harmony with biblical gospel proclamation. I urge you to sit down with your Bible and prayerfully, carefully read through the book of Acts. There we find genuine, Holy Spirit-filled preaching of the good news of Jesus Christ. You will observe there the prominence, sometimes even the primacy, of Christ’s resurrection. A dying Savior purchased our pardon; a living Savior proved the Father’s acceptance of His sacrifice! We must not separate these two glorious works of Christ, these two mighty pillars of the gospel.

Resurrection
. God’s people need this blessed, encouraging truth impressed upon their hearts. It is indeed food for the believer’s hungry soul. Charles Spurgeon leads the way by showing us the importance of the resurrection as gospel truth. Even in his day, many were straying from or distorting this essential doctrine. J. C. Ryle points out the remarkable contrast between the 
fact
 of the resurrection and the 
slowness
 of Christ’s disciples to believe it! Albert N. Martin then sets before us four truths about Christ’s rising from the dead that magnify its glory and splendor. What is the evidence for our Lord’s resurrection? William S. Plumer examines and details it for us, and then Thomas Manton describes the numerous benefits believers receive from it—what a treasure chest! That mighty preacher from the Great Awakening, George Whitefield, explains the power of the resurrection in the Christian’s soul, and David Martyn Lloyd-Jones demonstrates the crucial connection between Christ’s resurrection and the believer’s daily life. Finally, Charles Spurgeon gets the last word on this glorious subject: he tells us that Christ was the first to rise again and that the believer’s resurrection is guaranteed because of it!

Highlights include the first Holy Spirit revival on the day of Pentecost, the times of the Church Fathers, the Reformation, and the Great Awakening.

He goes on to describe the universal unrighteousness of men and their obligation to obey all of God’s law, pointing out that without perfect obedience the sinner could only be saved at the expense of justice. If sinners are saved then, it must be through a plan where God remains just and yet justifies the ungodly. And so it was that Christ kept the law perfectly and paid its penalty fully for His people so that they might be declared righteous.

It condemns; it cannot justify.” He goes on to declare that there is a righteousness “which meets the case of the unrighteous in every part.” How can we characterize this righteousness? Among other things, it is the righteousness of God, a righteousness without the law, a righteousness to which the Scriptures bear witness, and a righteousness perfectly suited to the unrighteous. Bonar then turns to justification by faith, pointing out that it is God who justifies the ungodly with a righteous, complete, irreversible, and divine justification.

According to Griffin, every aspect of this plan was taken into God’s own hands, motivated by nothing but His own glory and compassion for a ruined world. Included was sending His Son to bear the sins of many, enlightening the world by gospel preaching, insuring the salvation of His elect and their sanctification, and creating and preserving His Church. Furthermore, every part of this was brought about independently of His creatures. Indeed, had God not taken salvation into His own hands, not a single fallen creature would ever have reached the kingdom of heaven.

Sanctification is—1) the result of our union with Christ, 2) a consequence of regeneration, 3) certain evidence of the indwelling Spirit, 4) a sure mark of God’s election, 5) a thing that will always be seen, 6) a thing for which every believer is responsible, 7) a thing which grows, 8) a thing which depends on diligent use of Scriptural means, 9) a thing which does not exempt one from inward spiritual conflict, 10) a thing which cannot justify a man, yet pleases God, 11) a thing which will be absolutely necessary in the Final Judgment, and 12) a thing that is required to prepare us for heaven.",Preço: 0.43,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/sanc/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sanc&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: sancfg,Título: Sanctification,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: In his book entitled 
Holiness, 
J. C. Ryle says, ""If the Bible is true, it is certain that unless we are 'sanctified,' we shall not be saved."" Throughout history, confusion has surrounded the doctrine of sanctification because finding the biblical balance in this subject is not easy. Some utterly reject a place for God's Law in the life of New Covenant believers, while others love God's Law and find it a blessed rule of life. 
 
In this edition of the Free Grace Broadcaster, A. W. Pink introduces our subject by asking crucial questions that inevitably arise regarding sanctification. Octavius Winslow offers a useful definition of the meaning of sanctification. J. C. Ryle then discusses the nature of sanctification, giving us a survey of its important elements. Winslow gives us a second article, explaining that all sanctification begins in Christ: His cross and atoning work, His intercession, and His Mediatorial fullness all lay the foundation and secure the sanctification of every believer. John Murray discusses the vital distinction between definitive and progressive sanctification. In his second article, Pink describes the two aspects of sanctification: mortification and vivification, both inseparable in the life of God's true children. Abraham Booth sets the motive of sanctification before us. Pink shows the difference between sanctification and justification. In two articles, Horatius Bonar shows us that holiness consists of the little things of life, and urges us to shine forth in reflection of Christ's glorious holiness.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/sancfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sancfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sancfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Satan is a great, strong, and wise enemy of God in this world and he is always working with an artfulness and cunning peculiar to himself.
 
The particular objects of his evil designs are believers who are diligently trying to stay loyal to God’s truth.
 
As we look at our human weakness and ignorance, and compare them with Satan’s greatness, wisdom and enmity, how easy it is to see that our only safety is in Christ.
 
In the end, Mason quotes James 4:7 which he calls “one little passage which is the divine direction” for opposing Satan.

It is not revolutionary nor is it obviously heretical, but aims at “peace and unity.” Toning down the true gospel’s offensive doctrines and smoothing its rough edges, Satan’s gospel has great appeal to the carnal mind. Sadly, many who are deluded by it will in the end hear the most terrifying words, “I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” Pink concludes with timely advice for us all, “How necessary it is then to find out where we really are; to examine ourselves and see whether we be in the faith.”",Preço: 0.95,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/sahg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sahg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sahg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: scts,Título: Satan Considering the Saints,Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon,"Descrição: Have you ever thought about how Satan sizes up the saints as he prepares a temptation? Charles Spurgeon has. In this sermon, he takes as his text Job 1:8 where the Lord questions Satan, asking if he has considered His servant Job. Spurgeon shares his thoughts about how Satan carries out his work and what he considers about his prey. Satan aims to find any vulnerability that will allow him to further his intent to injure the saint and spoil his usefulness, among other malevolent designs. He considers potential weak points including our infirmities, our state of mind, the objects of our affection, our position among men, and our condition in the world. So what is the outcome? The Lord, in His sovereignty and lovingkindness, limits how far Satan can go while sustaining and sanctifying His children in the midst of their trials.",Preço: 0.61,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/scts/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=scts&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=scts&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Lord
 Jesus Christ. It is always so inconvenient to bow the knee to serve and follow Him. It will mean that we must take up the cross every day, denying ourselves and walking in His steps (Mat 16:24). That is the reason why men do not believe in Him. It is not because of lack of evidence, not because of the inadequacy of the Bible, not because there are no miracle workers in this century; it is because men and women do not want God. It was the people who saw Jesus’ miracles who cried ‘crucify Him.’ The nine of the ten men healed of leprosy could still not be bothered to give any doxology to the Lord (Luk 17:12-19). God has given this Word as the means of sinners’ salvation. Then let us be satisfied with it, heed it, and obey.”

 Scofield Reference Bible
 of 1917. It traces Scofield’s original thoughts and holds them to the light of the Scriptures. The result shows the unorthodoxy in method and substance of the whole system of dispensationalism.
 
Cyrus Ingerson Scofield (1843-1921) was an American theologian, minister, and writer. He first trained as a lawyer and was elected to the Kansas legislature in 1871. He converted to evangelical Christianity in 1879 and came under the mentorship of Pastor James H. Brookes, a prominent dispensationalist premillennialist. In 1883 Scofield accepted the pastorate of a small congregational church in Dallas, Texas, which grew from fourteen to over five hundred members by 1895, when he became pastor of Moody’s church and headed Moody’s Northfield Bible Training School in Northfield, Massachusetts. When the 
Scofield Reference Bible
 was published in 1909, it quickly became the most influential statement of dispensational premillennialism and had a great impact throughout the world.",Preço: 1.37,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/sot3/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sot3&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: NÃO

Código: scrifg,"Título: Scripture, The",Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: The Bible is among other things a book of revealed truth. That is, certain facts are revealed that could not be discovered by the most brilliant mind. These facts are of such a nature as to be past finding out. They were hidden behind a veil, and until certain men who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost took away that veil, no mortal man could know them. This lifting of the veil of unknowing from undiscoverable things we call divine revelation.
 
 The Bible, however, is more than a volume of hitherto unknown facts about God, man and the universe. It is a book of exhortation based upon those facts. By far the greater portion of the book is devoted to an urgent effort to persuade people to alter their ways and bring their lives into harmony with the will of God as set forth in its pages.
 
 No man is better for knowing that God in the beginning created the heavens and the earth. The devil knows that, and so did Ahab and Judas Iscariot. No man is better for knowing that God so loved the world of men that he gave his only begotten Son to die for their redemption. In hell there are millions that know that. Theological truth is useless until it is obeyed. The purpose behind all doctrine is to secure moral action.
 
 What is generally overlooked is that truth as set forth in the Christian Scriptures is a moral thing; it is not addressed to the intellect only, but to the will also. It addresses itself to the total man, and its obligations cannot be discharged by grasping it mentally. Truth engages the citadel of the human heart and is not satisfied until it has conquered everything there. The will must come forth and surrender its sword. It must stand at attention to receive orders, and those orders it must joyfully obey. Short of this any knowledge of Christian truth is inadequate and unavailing.
 
 Bible exposition without moral application raises no opposition. It is only when the hearer is made to understand that truth is in conflict with his heart that resistance sets in. As long as people can hear orthodox truth divorced from life they will attend and support churches and institutions without objection. The truth is a lovely song, become sweet by long and tender association; and since It asks nothing but a few dollars, and offers good music, pleasant friendships, and a comfortable sense of well-being, it meets with no resistance from the faithful. Much that passes for New Testament Christianity is little more than objective truth sweetened with song and made palatable by religious entertainment…

In the end, God will try us—and His trial will be according to truth.
Whether our inquiry of ourselves proves we are truly God’s children or still in our sin-cursed condition, either discovery will be to our great advantage.

Reminding us that Christ gave this as the first and great commandment, Payson offers nine characteristics of true love to God: 1) a just view of His character, 2) love for His law, 3) rejoicing in His government, 4) love for His children, 5) love for advancing His kingdom, 6) frequent and joyful thoughts of Him, 7) delight in the ways He manifests Himself, 8) a disposition to keep His commandments, and 9) deep humiliation for past transgressions. By way of application, Payson poses a question that we would do well to ask ourselves: “The love of God is one grand characteristic of His children in distinction from the unbelieving world.

Código: smlb,"Título: Sick Man Left Behind, The",Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon,"Descrição: A sermon on 2 Timothy 4:20.  ""These are among the last words of Paul the Apostle, for we find them in the closing verses of the last of his epistles. The chapter reminds us of a dying man’s final adieu to his best beloved friend, in the course of which he calls to mind the associates of his life. Among his memories of love we find Paul recollecting Trophimus, who had frequently shared with him the perils of rivers and perils of robbers which so largely attended the apostle’s career. He had left the good man ill at Miletum, and as Timothy at Ephesus was within an easy journey of him, there was no need to add a hint that he would visit him, for he would be sure to do it. The love of Jesus works in the hearts of His disciples great tenderness and unity. The overflow of our Lord’s great soul has saturated all His true followers with brotherly affection: because Jesus has loved Paul, Paul loves Timothy, and Timothy must needs love Trophimus. From this love there arises communion of feeling, so that in sympathy they share each other’s joys and griefs. When one member rejoices the body rejoices, and when one member suffers the whole body suffers with it. Trophimus is sick, and Paul cannot forget him, though he himself expects in a few weeks to die a martyr’s death. Neither would he have Timothy ignorant of the fact, though twice within a few verses he hurries him to come to Rome, saying, “Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me” (2Ti 4:9). If Timothy could not personally visit the sick friend, yet it was well that he should know of his affliction, for he would then remember him in his prayers. “Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God” (1Jo 4:7). Let us remember those who are one with us in Christ, and especially let us bear on our hearts all those who are afflicted in mind, body, or estate. If we have had to leave Trophimus at Miletum, or at Brighton, or at Ventnor, let us leave our heart’s love with him. And if we hear that another Trophimus lies sick not far from our own abode, let us accept the information as in itself a sufficient summons to minister to the afflicted friend. May holy sympathy pervade all our souls, for, however active and zealous we may be, we have not yet reached a perfect character unless we are full of compassion, tender-hearted, and considerate of the sorrowful, for this is the mind of Christ.""",Preço: 0.35,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/smlb/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=smlb&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=smlb&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

And while sickness is indeed a misery, Ryle shows that, at the same time, it confers general benefits on mankind. He writes, “It is a blessing quite as much as a curse. It is a rough schoolmaster, I grant. But it is a real friend to man’s soul.” He goes on to describe some of the ways that God uses sickness for good and the special duties that its prevalence requires, concluding with some words of practical application.

Código: sith,Título: Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,Autor: Jonathan Edwards,"Descrição: Preached at Enfield, Connecticut on July 8, 1741, this is perhaps the greatest sermon ever preached in America—and is certainly among the most well known. Owing to its forthright dealing with God’s wrath and His intense hatred of sin and the sinner, it is also one of the most controversial. Indeed, for more than three-quarters of the sermon Edwards lays down a relentless stream of the most vivid and horrifying descriptions of the danger facing unregenerate men. While it is difficult to read such graphic language, there is abundant hope in the sermon’s conclusion. Edwards puts it this way, “And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open and stands calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners.”
 
While those who would rather ignore God’s justice in favor of His mercy condemn Edwards and his sermon, those who were present and actually heard him preach that day reacted in a decidedly different manner. According to the diary of Reverend Stephen Williams who attended the sermon, “Before the sermon was done there was a great moaning and crying through the whole House, ‘what shall I do to be saved; oh, I am going to hell, etc.’” The diary goes on to indicate that Edwards had to interrupt his sermon and come down to minister to those who were under such awful conviction. And so, in spite of what the scoffers might think or say, “the amazing and astonishing power of God” was manifested among the people that day—with many falling not into the hands of an angry God, but into the arms of a mighty Savior.",Preço: 0.69,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/sith/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sith&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sith&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

He continues by showing how this difference is evident in several spheres of Christian living which include reading the Scriptures, listening to the Word preached, prayer, conversing about the things of God, living a godly life, and passing out of this present world. Pink ends by showing in a few words what distinguishes a genuine Christian from one who is Christian in name only—not mere head knowledge, but a “God-given, Spirit-wrought faith in the heart.”",Preço: 0.06,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/sfao/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sfao&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

First, he describes the solid groundwork of this peace and its noble character. Next, he discusses its effects—joy, love, desire for holiness, help in bearing affliction, and boldness at God’s throne. He goes on to deal with interruptions of this peace, which include temptations of Satan, ignorance of true doctrine, unconfessed sin, and unbelief. Finally, Spurgeon gives good counsel on maintaining and gaining peace with God. To maintain it, one does well to look always to the cross of Christ, walk humbly with God, and walk in holiness, avoiding every appearance of evil.

On October 14, 1855, Charles Spurgeon preached Sermon No. 46 to several thousand gathered to hear him at New Park Street Chapel. The sermon publication contained an announcement of this Catechism. The text that morning was: “Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations” (Psa 90:1).
 
“I am persuaded that the use of a good Catechism in all our families will be a great safeguard against the increasing errors of the times, and therefore I have compiled this little manual...for the use of my own church and congregation. Those who use it in their families or classes must labor to explain the sense; but the words should be carefully learned by heart, for they will be understood better as years pass. May the Lord bless my dear friends and their families evermore…”—

Baptist Catechism

 By 1738, this catechism was adopted by the Philadelphia Association of Baptists in America, the spiritual parent of all Baptist churches in the USA.

Código: soco,Título: Struggles of Conscience,Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon,"Descrição: In this booklet, Charles Spurgeon encourages those who struggle with an overactive conscience—specifically, those believers who long to know and be cleansed of their iniquities, and those unbelievers who think they must have a deeper conviction of sin before they can trust in Christ. Spurgeon’s message consists of Scriptural consolation and instruction, a caution not to confuse the work of the Spirit and the work of the devil, and finally an exhortation to those who are struggling to trust in Christ. He concludes by urging the latter to simply “Come as you are! Take Christ to be your all in all now.”",Preço: 0.69,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/soco/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=soco&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=soco&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: sugc,Título: Subjection under God's Chastisement,Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: In this tract, A. W. Pink sets forth the believer’s proper response to God’s chastisement. All people are born into this world with an evil nature which manifests itself in a spirit of insubordination. Even after conversion, this rebellious nature is not entirely eradicated. Because of this, chastisement is needed to bring us into subjection to the Father. Pink examines various aspects of this subjection:
First, it denotes an acquiescence to God’s sovereign right to do with us as He pleases.
Second, it implies a renunciation of self-will.
Third, it acknowledges God’s righteousness and wisdom in dealing with us.
Fourth, it includes a recognition of His care and love for us.
Fifth, it involves an active performance of His will.
In the end, Pink reveals the two main reasons for this subjection—because He is our Father and because this is the secret of true happiness.",Preço: 0.14,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/sugc/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sugc&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: subsfg,Título: Substitution,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Lying at the heart of the Bible's blessed Gospel message are the themes of sin, death, God's holiness, justice, wrath, and 
the substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus Christ. 
This is why Paul wrote, ""Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures"" (1Co 15:3). Charles Spurgeon introduces this glorious subject of 
Substitution, 
proclaiming the heart of the Gospel
. 
Arthur Pink instructs us regarding the covenantal aspect of Christ's substitutionary work. Spurgeon then masterfully explains the Great Exchange: the believing sinner's sin and guilt laid upon Christ; Christ's righteousness upon believing sinners. Pink then carefully explains how Christ's substitution is a 
penal 
work. Octavius Winslow reveals how Christ's bloody substitution accomplished an entire pardon for His people. Piling up one Scripture upon another, John Owen gives us a delightful outline and summary of the Bible's revelation of sacrifice and substitution.

Surely their pleasures are not your pleasures and their tastes are not your tastes. With this, J. C. Ryle begins this little tract. He goes on to consider the reader’s preferences—perhaps you love the company of the worldly-minded, the pleasure-seeker, and the profane. There will be 
no
 such people in heaven. Perhaps you think that believers are too strict and serious and would rather avoid them. These will be the

Mary Ann died rejoicing in Jesus Christ at the early age of seventeen. Relating several conversations leading up to her death, Reid’s story demonstrates her remarkable faith. For example, two days before she died she said to her father, “I know that death’s pangs are on me, but I fear it not. He (Jesus) was three hours in death’s pangs Himself, and should He leave me the same time, I’ll get home at one o’clock; and oh, what a joyful hour.” As those of her household gathered around, her last request was this: “I have called you that I might see you once more, and exhort you for the last time to make 
sure
 of your interest in Jesus.

 Him, and you shall be happy in life and in death.”",Preço: 0.43,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/tdau/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=tdau&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: tcft,Título: Ten Commandments from the Westminster Larger Catechism,Autor: the Westminster Divines,"Descrição: During the early 1600s, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists suffered repeated cycles of persecution at the hands of the Church of England and the crown. The Puritans arose to defend Biblical worship. During the resulting civil war (1642-1649), hierarchical parishes and bishops were abolished by the then Puritan Parliament. A special assembly was appointed to draft a new structure; it met at the historic Westminster Abbey (adjoining the Houses of Parliament) in London. The Westminster Assembly held 1,163 sessions between July 1, 1643, and February 22, 1649.
 
This 
Westminster Confession
 was drafted for the Church of England, and has become the most important of the great Protestant creeds of the Reformation era. It is a summary of major Christian beliefs in thirty-three chapters. Classic reformed biblical theology permeates the confession, with emphasis on the covenant relationships between God and man. A 
Larger Catechism
 was prepared by the Westminster Assembly, to be used by ministers in the pulpit for public teaching (1648). A 
Shorter Catechism
 was published for instructing children.",Preço: 0.69,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/tcft/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=tcft&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=tcft&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: thanfg,Título: Thankfulness,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: ""I will extol thee my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness"" (Psa 145:1-6). The subject of this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster was chosen in 2004 after the devastation of Hurricane Ivan, in thankfulness to God for sparing Chapel Library. We pray it will be used by God to enflame your heart with thanksgiving to our great God. William Cooper, a Puritan preacher about whom little is known, introduces the theme of thankfulness by declaring why all men should be thankful. In another article he teaches us how to give thanks in everything, even affliction. Richard Sibbes, who inspired men such as John Cotton and David Martyn Lloyd-Jones, briefly describes thankfulness as the disposition of God's people. Thomas Manton explains the holy duty of thankfulness, while John Gill, with characteristic thoroughness, lists a catalogue of Christ-centered reasons for thanking the Triune God. In a message originally delivered to seamen, John Flavel shows how to give thanks for the mercies God has lavished upon us. Charles Spurgeon gives us three articles this time: he exhorts us to give thanks even in times of difficulty and then exposes ingratitude as a sin for which there is no excuse. He finally preaches from the story of the ten lepers whom Christ healed, in which only one returned to thank Him. We pray with all our hearts that your souls will be moved by this Broadcaster to greater and continual thankfulness to our merciful God. He has delivered our souls for ever in Christ Jesus.

Código: atonfg,Título: The Atonement,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: In his excellent work, 
The Attraction of the Cross
, Gardiner Spring said, “By the Christian atonement, I understand that satisfaction to divine justice made by the sufferings and death of Christ, in the room and stead of sinners, in virtue of which pardoning mercy is secured to all who believe the gospel.” This is a beautiful and concise definition of Christ’s redemptive work; nevertheless, these are fighting words in much of the religious world today. “Satisfaction to divine justice made by the sufferings and death of Christ” implies propitiation and the wrath of God. Liberal theologians and other professing Christians vehemently reject such a notion. Likewise, coupled with “in the room and stead of sinners,” it implies penal substitution and vicarious atonement, which are hotly debated and denied by other professing Christians. And, “in virtue of which pardoning mercy is secured to all who believe the gospel” implies election and particular redemption—doctrines utterly despised by some professing evangelicals. Much more could be said about and mined from this theologically rich definition, but the point should be clear: professing Christians do not agree on what the design, intent, and accomplishment of Christ’s death are. This is a tragedy, which becomes clearer when we ponder C. H. Spurgeon’s statement: “I do not believe we can preach the gospel…unless we preach the sovereignty of God in His dispensation of grace; nor unless we exalt the electing, unchangeable, eternal, immutable, conquering love of Jehovah; nor do I think we can preach the gospel unless we base it upon the special and particular redemption of His elect and chosen people that Christ wrought out upon the cross.” 
 
Your view of Christ’s atonement affects the way you think about God and His eternal purpose, the Person and work of Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit, and the way we preach the gospel—if indeed we are actually 
preaching
 the gospel. We earnestly pray that every reader will consider the work of Christ as we believe Scripture presents it and as some of the greatest preachers, evangelists, and missionaries that the world has ever known have preached it. Not all will agree with the contents of this FGB; but may we all love, praise, and adore the sovereign God of heaven and earth for the redemption accomplished in the atonement of Jesus Christ the Lord. May the Lord Christ be forever praised: “Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation” (Rev 5:9).

Código: dochfg,Título: The Deity of Christ,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Robert Lewis Dabney wrote, “Here we come to the prime article of revealed theology, a doctrine of deep significance. What we think about Jesus Christ affects not only questions surrounding the subsistence of the Godhead, but it also delves into entirely relevant issues, such as whether or not one should trust, obey, and worship Christ as God, the nature and efficacy of His atoning offices, as well as what constitutes a Church and what are its rites. He who believes in the divinity of Jesus Christ is a Christian; he who does not (whatever his profession) is a mere Deist. Without the Divinity, the Bible is, ‘the drama of Hamlet, with the part of Hamlet omitted.’ ” I wonder if we believe Dabney’s statements; or if, in our heart of hearts, we wonder if he is exaggerating just a bit? Is the doctrine of Christ’s deity that important? Really?
 
If we believe that the Scriptures are the inspired, infallible Word of God, then Jesus Christ is the foundation, the essential truth, of all that we believe as Christians. Mark Jones writes, “In theology, Christology has an importance that cannot be overstated. Christ’s person and work are the central point of Christian theology.” “Cannot be overstated”—it appears that Dabney and Jones agree on the importance of the 
person
 of Christ, especially the crucial doctrine of the 
deity
 of Christ. In fact, to ask, “Who is Jesus Christ?” is to ask the fundamental question that lies at the very heart of Western history. It is impossible to imagine that Christianity would ever have spread throughout the ancient world without one central truth burning like the sun at noonday—the man who died on Calvary’s cross and rose again the third day was and is truly and fully deity. “Jesus Christ is God” is the thought that changed the world 
forever
.
 
It would have been interesting to hear the tone of voice with which Charles Spurgeon delivered the following statement: “I cannot see how Jesus Christ can be anything but one of two things—either the Son of God or else a gross impostor who allowed his disciples to think him divine and used the virtues of his character to support his claim…Either God or an arch-deceiver he must have been.”
 
At Chapel Library, we believe with all our hearts that from Genesis to Revelation the Holy Scriptures teach that Jesus Christ is God. Antitrinitarians and cults, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses; atheists and agnostics, such as Bart Ehrman; and numerous others have relentlessly attacked Christ’s deity. We therefore present the latest issue of the 
Free Grace Broadcaster
—
The Deity of Christ. 
Numerous challenges presented themselves in bringing these articles together. Some of the most thorough articles in systematic theologies were highly technical, and unfortunately, often dry as dust! Such a glorious subject should fill our hearts with wonder, praise, and adoration rather than being an antidote for a sleepless night. On the other hand, articles that were more readable did not always deal thoroughly with the profound questions that have arisen over the centuries regarding this weighty and controversial subject. The resolution was to find readable articles and to move technical information to the footnotes; therefore, our readers will find more footnotes than usual. The subject was and is too vast and profound to cover well in forty-eight pages, so this FGB is merely a primer. Nevertheless, we pray with all our hearts that the reader will see something of the glory and beauty of the Word made flesh as these pages unfold.
 
The Puritan Isaac Ambrose introduces this FGB by declaring that one cannot find a more excellent subject to talk or write about than the person of Jesus Christ. Charles Hodge then gives us a brief survey of the OT teaching regarding Christ’s deity. Another Puritan, Thomas Brooks, demonstrates Christ’s deity by examining the honors due to God that the biblical writers bestow upon Jesus.

In it he deals with the Biblical answers to the following questions poised in the Introduction, and more. “What is ‘sanctification’: is it a quality or position? Is sanctification a legal thing or an experimental?—that is to say, is it something the believer has in Christ or in himself? Is it absolute or relative?—by which we mean, does it admit of degree or no? Is it unchanging or progressive? Are we sanctified at the time we are justified, or is sanctification a later blessing? How is this blessing obtained?—by something which is done for us, or by us, or both? How may one be assured he has been sanctified: what are the characteristics, the evidences, the fruits? How are we to distinguish between sanctification by the Father, sanctification by the Son, sanctification by the Spirit, sanctification by faith, sanctification by the Word?” May the reader be illumined by the Holy Spirit as he finds the answers herein!",Preço: 9.98,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/dosa/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dosa&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dosa&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

It is a sacred, exotic herb which has grown very scarce.” Modern misconception tends to relegate self-denial to an ancient world of monasteries, hair shirts, and self-flagellation. However, as Watson shows, there is nothing more Biblical or Christian than true self-denial. “Self-denial is the first principle of Christianity. It is the life-blood which must run through the whole body of religion.” Christ calls us to deny our wills, our own righteousness, our appetites, our ease, our inordinate passions, our relations, our estates, and even our lives for Him. There is no alternative to a life of self-denial: “There may be going to heaven without comfort, but there is no going there without self-denial.”",Preço: 0.96,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/dosd/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dosd&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dosd&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: lbcw,"Título: The London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689 with Preface, Baptist Catechism, and Appendix on Baptism",Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: The London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 played an important role in Baptist history. The Act of Uniformity of 1662 made the new Anglican Prayer Book mandatory for use in all Anglican, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Baptist churches in England. Moreover, the Anglican church abandoned the Westminster Confession and returned to the Thirty-Nine Articles as its official confession of faith. Consequently, with the restoration of the Monarchy, the English Baptists suffered persecution for their faith. In 1677, a group of Particular Baptists met for the purpose of producing a more expansive confession than the previous Baptist confession of 1644. They modeled the Second London Confession on the Westminster Confession, but with significant theological differences regarding church government and baptism. Persecution kept the 1677 document from being officially endorsed by Particular Baptists until 1689, when the Toleration Act was passed. This act enabled religious freedom to co-exist alongside the established churches in England and Scotland. As a result, representatives from over 100 Particular Baptist churches met in London from July 3-11 to discuss and endorse the 1677 document. Though the confession was published in 1677, the General Assembly of Particular Baptist Churches adopted it in 1689; hence it is commonly known as “the 1689.” The Westminster Confession, the Savoy Declaration, and the London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 are considered the most important Reformed confessions arising from the English-speaking world.",Preço: 2.74,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/lbcw/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=lbcw&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=lbcw&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: sosifg,Título: The Sinfulness of Sin,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: The purpose of this collection of articles is to press our hearts to honestly consider before heaven the dreadfulness of sin and the only hope for its pardon—Jesus Christ.
 
Therefore, Arthur W. Pink begins with a brief, biblical definition of sin, followed by William S. Plumer’s excellent exposition of sin as an 
infinite
 evil. Pink offers us a second article, explaining that there is nothing so vile as sin, as he describes its nature. Puritan Thomas Watson teaches us from vivid biblical descriptions that sin is a heinous thing, worthy of God’s just curse; while another Puritan, Ralph Venning, labors to show us that the heart of the sinfulness of sin is its relentless opposition to God; in fact, Venning says that if it could, sin would “ungod God.” A third Puritan, Samuel Bolton compares 
natural
 evils—natural disasters such as plagues, hurricanes, and earthquakes—with 
moral
 evil—sin—to teach us that sin is the greatest evil known to man! Watson then takes on the vital issue of degrees of sin, for many in his day and ours are deluded into thinking that God does not view one sin as greater than another. Furthermore, many of us have weak views of sin, so Edward Payson helps us to see that our sins are infinite, innumerable, and monstrous; thankfully, he points us to Jesus Christ and His redemptive work on the cross as the only remedy for the plague of our hearts. Again, pointing us to Christ, J. C. Ryle explains with great clarity our need for repentance from sin and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Charles Spurgeon displays the unknown depths of human sin and convincingly reveals that we really do not know what we are doing when we sin against God. The last word is from Octavius Winslow, who shows us that the one place where we may see our sins in all their depraved wickedness is the cross of Jesus Christ: from that extraordinary light, we will see our sins as they really are.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/sosifg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sosifg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=sosifg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

“But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God” (Heb 10:12).
 
This is a stunning declaration! Without the light of the Holy Spirit, diligent study, and meditation, we can read these twenty-one words without our hearts being touched or our souls being enflamed to worship. Lord, forgive us of our dullness, our backwardness! Here in twenty-one words, we have the work of Jesus Christ summarized, the eternal purpose of God displayed in the eternal Son of God. Here are the glories of “this man”—Christ the Son, Christ the Mediator, Christ the Prophet, Christ the Priest, Christ the King—set before us in short form.
 
Here is the forgiveness of sins accomplished in “one sacrifice” forever. Here is everything infinitely necessary to save and keep God’s people for all eternity! Everything! Appointed in eternity before Creation, sent into the world, incarnate by the miraculous conception in the Virgin’s womb, obedient to the Law, crucified, resurrected, ascended into heaven, and seated in glorious splendor at the right hand of His Father—Christ completed the work that His Father decreed before the foundation of the world. Here is the Surety, here is the Substitute come to die in horrifying agony upon the cruel cross of Calvary and to rise again by omnipotent power on the third day, conquering death, hell, the world, and Satan.
 
Every aspect and every detail of everything His Holy Father gave Him to do in order to save His people from the penalty, the power, the pleasure, and the presence of sin—everything—Jesus Christ accomplished it all. Christ’s Person and work are the reason for history, the focus of the Bible, the object of saving faith, and the singular hope for eternal life and the future.

I propose to offer a few words of friendly exhortation to young men.
 
“I am growing old myself, but there are few things I remember so well as the days of my youth. I have a most distinct recollection of the joys and the sorrows, the hopes and the fears, the temptations and the difficulties, the mistaken judgments and the misplaced affections, the errors and the aspirations, which surround and accompany a young man’s life.

A Treatise of Self-denial
 turns our attention again to Christ’s warning: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself” (Mat 16:24). The book is a Puritan classic: it is thorough, biblical, relevant, insightful, timeless, vital, God-honoring, convicting, and immensely important reading for every Christian. It is especially important for pastors, to restore to their preaching this fundamental doctrine. Manton skillfully and convincingly explores our need to deny self-dependence, self-will, self-love, and self-seeking.

He goes on to give Scriptural examples of those whose confession was self-serving and false, including Pharaoh, Saul, and Judas. Why were these confessions false? Because they were selfish, superficial, impulsive, and temporary. In true confession, the sinner—as far as he is able—comes to see sin as God sees it: a consummate evil and willful rebellion against God and His commandments. The truly repentant sinner draws near with an honest heart, in full assurance of faith, knowing that “if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins” (1 John 1:9).",Preço: 0.09,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/tcat/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=tcat&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

He applies these things to our prayer meetings and our personal prayer lives. ""Look above, Christian brethren and sisters, and let us weep. O God, Thou hast given us a mighty weapon, and we have permitted it to rust. Thou hast given us that which is mighty as Thyself, and we have let that power lie dormant.

examines in detail the common modern message sometimes called “easy-believism,” where justification in Christ is presented without mention of one’s responsibility to forsake sin and live set apart from the world. This gospel holds that one may “make a decision” to “receive Christ,” without bowing to His authority over one’s life. The problem is that many conclude: “a little sin won’t hurt—I’m just carnal, and God has saved me any way.” This false gospel leaves the professing Christian without any power over sin and a false confidence in heaven, even to the point of resisting calls to repent because “I don’t need to; I’m already saved.” Romans 6 is used to develop a Biblical understanding of self-denial, and passages in 1 and 2 Timothy are used to explain the deceitful nature of selfish sin.

A brief overview: because of man’s depravity, he will never choose God. At the same time, God is not obligated to save any man. So how does anyone get saved? Before the foundation of the world, apart from any merit in man, God chose a definite number of individuals for salvation and gave them to His Son. This is election. It is a sovereign act of God, it is unchangeable, it is eternal, and it is unconditional—that is, based on pure grace and nothing else. Why did God do it this way?

Código: utti,Título: Understanding the Times,Autor: Ken Ham,"Descrição: Understanding the Times 
is timely and essential reading, because the western Church is in a free-fall of decline. Compromise has undermined the Bible, and the impact of this abandonment of belief in its authority is breaking like storm-driven waves on biblical evangelicalism. Once-thriving churches are being abandoned and transformed into dance studios, tattoo parlors, and nightclubs. Why? In this illustrated presentation, Ken Ham gives helpful insights into the reasons for this decline, which started with attacks on issues like the age of the earth and the accuracy of the history in Genesis. Ken shares how churches and individuals can stand against destructive, millions-of-years/evolution-based ideas and successfully rebuild the foundation of biblical authority in our culture.

The latter, which he calls a useless kind of religion, is the most common way to hell for those who profess to be Christians. According to Ryle, useless religions take two forms: those in which Jesus Christ does not fill the principal place and those which join anything with Christ in the matter of saving one’s soul.

It will simply be release from the physical bondage of a prison cell, but not from the spiritual bondage of sin—under which every human being lives from birth. He goes on to describe the real freedom that God mercifully provides. God's gift of freedom delivers us from our deadly bondage of sin. “When Jesus came to this earth, He came to set free all those who would repent and believe the gospel (Mark 1:15), to set them free from the bondage of sin and all that this brings.”",Preço: 0.06,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/wifr/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=wifr&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

5:40
). In this excellent tract, Henry Mahan examines the Scriptural basis for this sad truth. In the first place, sinners are spiritually blind because “the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not…” (2 Cor 4:4). Only the Father can draw men to the Son. Secondly, sinners are spiritually dead because of their sins. Before they can come to Christ they must be regenerated by God’s Spirit. Finally, men won’t come to Christ because they hate God’s terms, which have always been repentance and faith. They will not abandon their rebellion until God has stripped them of all their self-righteous rags. Mahan ends with this plea, “God give us preachers today who will rout the sinners out of their refuge of lies and exalt the God of the Bible.”",Preço: 0.09,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/wmwn/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=wmwn&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Going beyond the normal interpretation, he urges the congregation not to consider it only in relation to nations and churches, but to apply the lesson to their own lives, taking it “home each one to his own heart.” He goes on to consider the leafy—but fruitless—fig tree as a picture of those who profess faith in Christ, but show no fruit in their lives. He does this under three headings: there are such people in the church, these will be inspected by Jesus at the final judgment, and the results will be “very terrible.” Spurgeon concludes with a prayer that none of his hearers will suffer such a fate: “Holy Spirit, produce fruit in us this day, through faith in Jesus Christ our Lord!”",Preço: 0.52,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/wftr/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=wftr&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=wftr&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

He puts it this way, “In order to make room for the display of the divine glory in Christ Jesus and His salvation, there would come a withering of all the glory wherein man boasts himself.” According to Spurgeon, the Spirit’s withering prepares the soil for the sowing and implanting by which salvation is wrought. He then lays out seven observations regarding this work: it is very unexpected, it tears down in preparation for a new creation, it is universal and complete in this tearing down, it is painful, it is inevitable, and finally, it is a prelude to great happiness.

However, while this world is surely passing away, man is immortal. He will spend eternity either in great joy or in deep darkness and sorrow. So the critical question is this: how can a man make sure that his life after death will be spent in the light and joy of heaven?

Indeed, he makes it clear that the wrath of God “is as much a Divine perfection as is His faithfulness, power, or mercy.” According to Pink, God’s wrath springs from His holiness and His inveterate hatred of sin.

The Redeemer bade His disciples remember Him in His death, but there is not a word in Scripture, from Genesis to Revelation, which tells us to celebrate His birth. Moreover, who knows when, in what month, He was born? The Bible is silent thereon. Is it without reason that the only birthday commemorations mentioned in God’s Word are Pharaoh’s (Gen 40:20) and Herod’s (Mat 14:6)? Is this recorded 'for our learning'?

Regeneration is absolutely necessary for you to do anything acceptable to God.


Without generation there is no faith; without faith it is impossible to please God.


If you are not born again, all attempts at reformation are nothing in God’s sight.


Prayers of the unregenerate are an abomination to the Lord.




If this is you, what should you do? According to Boston, you should “fix your thoughts upon Him offered to you in the gospel as fully suited to your case.” That is, Jesus’ death on the cross perfectly satisfied the justice of God, bringing in everlasting righteousness for repentant sinners.

Isenhour comments on Titus 2:3-5 which describes older women teaching young women to “love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed.” Throughout this tract, Isenhour expands on the admonition to be discreet, which he defines as “judicious, cautious; wise in conduct and management, especially as to matters of propriety and self-control.” He concludes with two observations: 1) a young woman who lives up to these qualities, lives a life of “nobility, beauty, usefulness and sublimity” and 2) to be a discreet woman “is more to be desired than education, fame, honor, and earthly glory.”",Preço: 0.06,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/ywad/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ywad&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: ,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: dolh,"Título: Death of Legal Hope, The",Autor: Abraham Booth,"Descrição: The Death of Legal Hope
 is a bold correction to our natural tendency to live as though we were “saved by works.” Even Christians may profess to believe in salvation by faith alone, but perhaps without realizing it they may be leaning on their own morality and good works to earn favor with God. Booth capably shows us from the Scriptures that this cannot be. When one comes to Christ, he dies to any hope of satisfactory law-keeping and enters into the all-sufficient grace of God freely bestowed. His love for Christ then motivates him in evangelical obedience to the moral law as part of his spiritual worship. Only then does he please God and worship acceptably. This message at once both liberates from legal bondage and replaces a false hope and insecurity with blessed confidence in the full and free salvation of our sovereign God.",Preço: 2.33,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/dolh/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dolh&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dolh&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

 presents biblical principles for seeking and preparing for a spouse. You must first seek Christ as Lord and Savior, and then depend upon God to direct to your spouse in His timing. With this foundation, you must seek a spouse actively in God’s way: by much prayer for wisdom, depending upon God, and discerning if a potential spouse is suitable—by assessing reputation, countenance and demeanor, speech, apparel (and the motivations it reveals), companions, education, and counsel of parents. God will grant success if we renounce our own wisdom, practice self-denial, and avoid dependence upon outward appearances.

Código: wresfg,Título: A Wife's Respect,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: We offer the latest issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster: 
A Wife’s Respect. 
Horatius Bonar offers an encouraging look at the creation narratives of Genesis and draws parallels with New Testament authors regarding husband and wife, Christ and church. In a single page, Thomas Vincent enumerates the general responsibilities of a wife, according to the Scripture and the Westminster Shorter Catechism. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones examines a woman’s reverence for her husband and suggests that we should understand it as a “respectful deference.” Then in a detailed discussion, Ezekiel Hopkins gives a very helpful overview of a wife’s role as he describes what a respectful life should look like. Taking this theme even further, John Brown considers a woman’s submission, her pure conduct, and her inward ornaments. This article will take a little work and thought on the reader’s part, but it will richly pay back the investment. George Swinnock discusses a wife’s holiness and her husband’s praise for her, as well as what her submission includes. What happens when a woman’s husband does not obey the Word of truth? John Brown addresses this problem with hope in and help from Christ. Finally, J. R. Miller discusses a wife’s beautiful role in home-making and the reality that a godly husband will always find such a woman lovely in his sight.
 
We pray that the FGB on 
A Husband’s Love 
coupled with 
A Wife’s Respect 
will help Christ’s people everywhere to glimpse something of the beauty of marriage, when it reflects His sacrificial love and headship of His eternally loved Bride, the church.

Código: ascefg,Título: Ascension,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Do we contemplate, meditate on, and thank God for Christ’s ascension? Christ’s ascension led to His 
continuing
 work for us in heaven. His high priestly intercession and the gift of the Holy Spirit are His great love gifts for His blood-bought people.
 
Therefore, we want to encourage all our readers to consider this most blessed subject with this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster: 
Ascension. 
Charles Spurgeon introduces the subject by recounting the events leading to Christ’s ascension and the stunning beauty of His rising from this world to the glories of heaven. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones explains the unfolding of redemption through the descending and ascending of our blessed Savior. Isaac Ambrose describes 
that
 Christ ascended, as well as 
how
, 
where to
, and 
why
 He ascended, while William Plumer reveals the wonderful works of Christ at God’s right hand. What are some of the benefits of Christ’s heavenly session? John Gill shines Scripture light on this blessed work of our Lord. In a brief article, A. W. Pink surveys Christ’s intercession for the people of God. Part of Christ’s heavenly work at His Father’s right hand is the pouring out of the Holy Spirit: Jonathan Edwards believes that this is the sum and substance of Jesus’ blessings purchased for His people! Why did Jesus Christ ascend? John Flavel answers with six reasons. Then, in a second article from Spurgeon, we learn that Christ’s ascension declares Him victorious in finishing the work of redemption. Finally, Edward Payson asks us several penetrating questions about the Scriptures and Christ’s ascension: do we really believe the testimony of the Word of God about these astounding events?
 
It is our heart’s desire for God’s people to read with great joy the biblical witness of Christ rising into glory, sitting at His Father’s right hand, interceding for His eternally loved people, and sending the Holy Spirit on His great mission. Christ died on Calvary’s cross, rose again from the dead, and ascended into glory for His people. Ascension is a vital and cardinal part of the truth. We pray you will feast on its rich food.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/ascefg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ascefg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ascefg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: medifg,Título: Meditation,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: To encourage God’s people, we present this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster on Meditation. Meditation is essential for a healthy walk with Christ and growth in grace. Charles Spurgeon introduces this subject with a helpful overview of the importance, practice, and benefits of biblical meditation. Thomas Watson defines what it is. Thomas Manton is convinced meditation is a biblical duty, and he tells us why. What is the nature of meditation? Isaac Ambrose answers that and describes the time, place, and matter of that holy practice. William Bates beautifully instructs us in occasional meditation, focusing on God’s creation, and George Swinnock offers five descriptions of solemn and set meditation on sacred subjects. Are there real dangers in neglecting this holy act of deep thinking? Edmund Calamy lists twelve! And they are sobering. John Owen, a deeply spiritually-minded pastor and theologian, presents us with practical helps for meditating upon God, and then A. W. Pink meticulously shows us how to approach a biblical text so that we can chew the Bread of Life. Are you new to meditation and wonder what to meditate about? In a second article, Thomas Watson gives a beautiful panorama of biblical themes to fix our hearts on, starting with God in eternity, progressing to Christ in history, and extending to heaven and hell. Then, Jonathan Edwards urges us to show our love to Christ; he does so by giving us a wonderful description of His loveliness. Spurgeon, a great advocate and practitioner of meditation, closes this issue by instructing us with sweet meditations of Jesus Christ our Lord. And how precious they are! Be forewarned: meditation is hard in our too-busy, distracted world; but this FGB is a brief “how-to” that we pray will fan the flames of your heart to seek the glory of Christ in Scripture and to love Him as never before.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/medifg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=medifg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=medifg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: mosi,Título: Mortification of Sin,Autor: John Owen,"Descrição: Mortification of Sin
 is the classic work by John Owen that challenges every believer to apply biblical truth to purify themselves through mortification. To do so, the Christian must learn to recognize the activity and deception of indwelling sin. He must lean upon the Holy Spirit to accomplish the work of mortification. His whole life and comfort in Christ depends on his engaging in this work daily and continually. In two excellent chapters, Owen explains common misconceptions about mortification, and what it actually is. Mortification requires both faith and whole-hearted diligence. The believer is warned about his danger when he allows himself to entertain even small habitual sins. Then Owen challenges the reader to enter the fight at the first sign of sin, to lean upon Christ and the perfect work of the Holy Spirit. “You must be always killing sin, or it will be killing you!”",Preço: 4.15,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/mosi/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mosi&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mosi&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: adopfg,Título: Adoption,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: In this issue of the 
Free Grace Broadcaster 
on adoption,  Robert Alexander Webb introduces us to the importance of this vital doctrine, giving us three reasons why it is so important. Charles Spurgeon declares that God’s act of predestinating sinners to the adoption of children is an act of pure grace. What are the causes of adoption? John Gill answers by demonstrating the gracious work of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as the cause of that miracle of grace. John Murray describes the Fatherhood of God biblically, distinguishing it from the false notion that all people are the children of God. He also explains that adoption is neither justification nor regeneration, while being intimately connected to both. Abraham Booth tells us that God’s grace reigns in adoption and offers clear biblical ways that believers are united to God and made part of His heavenly family. What is the nature of adoption? And what are its benefits? Do you know? David Martyn Lloyd-Jones explains both with biblical clarity and the force of truth. Scottish theologian and minister John Dick sharply contrasts the satanic family of which believers were once a part with the glory and splendor of being in God’s righteous family. How does one know if he or she is indeed a child of God? Octavius Winslow beautifully explains the witness of God’s Spirit in our souls that we know that we 
are
 the children of God. Then, with clarity and moving imagery, John Eadie makes a valiant attempt to tell us what it means when the apostle John says, “We shall be like him”—like Christ Jesus! And finally, Thomas Reade helps us to consider the sacred evidence of sonship. He, like Winslow, wants to help us answer the question, “Am I a child of God?” No regenerate soul can read these thoughts without being moved and without desiring to finish his course to the glory of Christ Who saved us.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/adopfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=adopfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=adopfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: ptho,Título: Preserving the Honor of Marriage: Biblical Guidance from the Puritans,Autor: Joel Beeke,"Descrição: Preserving the Honor of Marriage
 explores the biblical command for marriage, “submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God” (Eph 5:21). It is needed in our day when, in many cases, submission in marriage has become either oppressive or irrelevant. 
But to honor our spouse is to honor the God of marriage and the covenant of marriage. Fulfilling our God-assigned roles is a matter of faithfulness to God. Two principles underlie mutual submission: Christ and His Church, and the marriage covenant. The love of Christ for His Church and the Church’s joyfully following Christ are the foundations for biblical submission. Submission is Christ-honoring when we see it as a vital part of covenantal commitment. This booklet is important for those who are married and those preparing for marriage.",Preço: 0.82,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/ptho/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ptho&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ptho&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: rpot,Título: Regulative Principle of the Church,Autor: Sam Waldron,"Descrição: Does God expect us to worship Him in a particular way? Is there a blueprint for the church? Sam Waldron gives a distinct affirmative while he brings these related questions together in an insightful discussion of the regulative principle. God calls His church to worship Him according to His commands and the apostolic example, not our good ideas. The history, biblical context, function, and limitations of the regulative principle are discussed in detail. While God’s people throughout history have often seen the regulative principle as focused on worship, this study demonstrates that a more biblical approach will also emphasize that the church, its organization, and its functions should be carefully regulated by Scripture as well. This emphasis helps to clarify issues and objections that relate to this vital doctrine.",Preço: 2.05,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/rpot/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=rpot&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=rpot&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: rdepfg,Título: Radical Depravity,Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: Jesus Christ saves radically depraved men, women, and children from their sins. However, to understand, believe, and love the good news about the crucified and resurrected Savior, we must first understand our condition. Thus, we offer this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster: Radical Depravity. Arthur Pink introduces us to this weighty subject by asking the question, “Is man a totally and thoroughly depraved creature by nature?” Thomas Reade then tells us about the deadly consequences and bitter fruits of Adam’s fall: in Adam all die. We then consider Joel Beeke’s helpful survey of the doctrine of human depravity. A second article by Thomas Reade leads us to a painful truth: the heart of man is evil. But he does not leave us there: he takes us to the blessed Son of God for deliverance. John Owen describes with great clarity the depraved and corrupted state of man’s mind and teaches us that the only remedy for this great darkness is the new birth: “You must be born again.” Loraine Boettner explains the extent and effects of original sin, which results in human inability in the matters of salvation. What is our true spiritual condition outside of Christ? Charles Spurgeon declares that we are legally, spiritually, and eternally dead. Nevertheless, he also tells us that we can be legally, spiritually, eternally alive by faith in Jesus Christ the Son! We then hear from John Flavel that in mercy, grace, and love, God draws sinners to Jesus Christ, gradually, suitably, powerfully, effectually, and finally. That is indeed good news! J. C. Ryle brings our subject to a close by asking a penetrating question: “Are you dead or alive?” Each of us, dear readers, must answer that question.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/rdepfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=rdepfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=rdepfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

The author approaches his subject using Ephesians 1:11 as the text: God “worketh all things after the counsel of his own will.” Today’s reader will benefit from the biblical explanation of many of God’s attributes as properties of His divine will, what this doctrine tells us about God, and how it is used of God to bring wisdom, pleasure, and contentment to our lives.",Preço: 0.96,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/mobr/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mobr&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mobr&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

John Ploughman’s Talk
, the author again rolls back eloquence in order to use common everyday word pictures to convey practical biblical wisdom. As such, this volume is especially useful to all Christians in their quest to apply the Scriptures to grow in godliness. Children of all ages during family worship will relate to its common examples.

Código: cwgofg,Título: Communion with God,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: We cannot imagine that we know God, if we do not have communion with Him. Puritan Matthew Barker defines that holy communion for us as one who walked in experiential Christianity. Charles Spurgeon then argues that the new birth establishes a principle of life from which communion with God springs in all regenerate souls. What is the nature of this communion? Benjamin Keach gives us a wonderful overview with heart moving, biblical thoughts. In the first of three articles, John Owen introduces us to communion with the Father. Matthew Barker offers another article by helping us to obtain and maintain that holy communication with our Savior and Lord. Owen then gives a wonderful glimpse at what communion with Christ looks like, sprinkling his text with the Song of Solomon. Can we honestly say that we hunger and thirst, even yearn and long for God’s presence and fellowship? Thomas Brooks beautifully lays out what the regenerate soul seeks after. In his last article, Owen gives a very brief look at communion with the Holy Spirit—a practice that is probably rare for many. John Flavel fills our hearts and souls with the loveliness of the heavenly privilege that we have in communion with God. And Thomas Brooks brings this issue to a close by calling us to keep our communion with God alive and healthy as a sound defense against Satan’s snares.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/cwgofg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cwgofg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cwgofg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: ange,Título: Anger,Autor: Max Doner,"Descrição: Anger! is a problem in every human life, and can be an acute sin for Christians. In this concise but complete analysis, we see both righteous and sinful anger explained. All Christians must know the difference: we must cultivate the one biblically, and mortify the other in order to avoid sinning against our holy God. The cause of sinful anger is carefully diagnosed: pride in rebelling against God’s rule in our lives—as revealed in His daily providences that block our expectations. The text spotlights step-by-step biblical solutions, leading to a true, trustworthy, and lasting victory that does not mask the symptoms, but destroys sinful anger at its root.

Código: sminfg,Título: Spiritual Mindedness,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: We who profess to be the blood-bought people of God really must answer the question, “Am I spiritually minded?” To help us answer biblically, Charles Simeon introduces us to the subject of carnal minds and spiritual minds. John Owen then explains what spiritual mindedness is. D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones gives us a powerful exposition of what a carnal mind is, and why it is death. Another question, which is foundational to this subject, is, “Do you have God’s Spirit?” J. C. Ryle answers that question, listing what the Holy Spirit produces in the life of believers, which includes making them spiritually minded. It is true that spiritually minded people have carnal thoughts, and carnally minded people have spiritual thoughts. But spiritually minded people long to be free from carnal thinking, and Jeremiah Burroughs arms us for that battle. What then is the evidence of a spiritual mind? John Owen speaks directly to that question in his second article. And then Jeremiah Burroughs guides us with sound biblical principles for cultivating a spiritual mind. This FGB closes with three articles that give God’s children important things to think about: Thomas Manton urges us to think about death. Samuel Davies points out the folly of not contemplating life in this world in the awesome light of eternity, for every one of us will spend eternity in hell or in the glories of Christ’s holy presence and everlasting joy. Finally, Thomas Reade lifts our eyes of faith and fastens them on heavenly joys. Can you imagine anything better to meditate on than the attributes of the Triune God Who saves us; the Prophet, Priest, and King Who has done everything infinitely necessary to redeem and preserve us for His glorious kingdom; and the Holy Spirit Who births us into that kingdom and empowers us for our journey to the Celestial City?

Arthur Pink shows us that the Scriptures call us to this holy exercise, and Octavius Winslow asks us to dig deep, as we answer his question, “Are you alive or dead?” The Lord’s Supper is always a crucial time to examine our hearts, and Jonathan Edwards helps us to understand who should come to the Table and who should not. Thomas Wilcox gives us some penetrating questions by which we may examine our profession of Christ, and Charles Spurgeon asks yet another pointed question: “Does Christ dwell in you?” Finally, Ryle closes with brief but powerful applications of where to begin and how to proceed with self-examination.

Código: rttifg,Título: Redeem the Time,Autor: Charles H. Spurgeon,"Descrição: As we begin the new year, we offer you the latest issue of the FGB, 
Redeem the Time
. Octavius Winslow introduces this crucial subject, proclaiming time a solemn, priceless gift. Jonathan Edwards wholeheartedly agrees and reminds us that eternal happiness or misery depends on how we use time. A. A. Hodge then briefly offers definitions of God, time, and eternity. Do we think of time as opportunity? Richard Baxter says yes, we should, and gives numerous reasons to support his answer. Following that, David Martyn Lloyd-Jones calls us to heed Paul’s exhortation to buy up opportunities to serve the Lord Jesus. Baxter, again, is not likely to win many friends among modern Christians as he strongly exposes time thieves that rob us of our precious gift; but you should read him carefully, pray earnestly, and examine your heart by Scripture before you write him off. Lloyd-Jones urges us to recognize the true differences between believers and the lost world, arguing that the way believers use their time should be a witness to the lost. Charles Spurgeon asserts and affirms from Scripture that our time is limited and short: how we use every second matters. Jeremiah Burroughs makes alarmingly clear that our abuse of time may lead to our most dreadful loss—the loss of our never-dying souls for eternity. Finally, Spurgeon declares the good news that Jesus Christ died on Calvary’s cross and rose again to save sinners. But you must believe that astonishing good news now, now, now! So, what time is it, friend? It is time to repent, believe, and be saved; or it is time to serve the Lord Who loved and gave Himself for us. You may not have another day for either. We urge you: make the time to meditate on this vital subject—the last grains of your hourglass are running towards eternity.

Código: dgus,Título: Does God Use Sickness?,Autor: John C. Ryle,"Descrição: Sickness is everywhere and reaches everyone in this sinful world. We all experience its annoying, debilitating, and even deadly force. Can something so painful as sickness be good? J. C. Ryle says yes! In God's providence in this world, sickness is good, because it reminds men of death, makes them think of God, softens their hearts, humbles us before God, and tests our professions of faith. Since sickness comes from the wise and good hand of God even into such a sinful world as ours we should respond to sickness by preparing to meet God, bearing patiently the sickness that comes to us, and helping our fellow men in it. What will 
you
 do when you fall ill? Will you gripe and grumble? Or will you seek soul-solace, as well as physical healing, from the Great Physician of souls? Christ is the great Lord, Savior, and Healer. Cleave to Him through your times of sickness.

The Scriptures have much to say concerning the body and its healing.

The Lord graciously gives many promises and much instruction for his people who are seeking healing.

 is a wonderful overview of the Puritan movement in the 1600s that has given the English-speaking world its richest depository of theological writings, with practical applications in every area of life. Part One helps us to understand the fascinating history as the British monarchy took some unpredictable turns and various factions literally fought for control of Britain’s religious life. Part Two ably illucidates the lives of the Puritans with brief summaries of 20+ Puritan leaders. These were real men whose contributions came at great personal cost to themselves and their families. Part Three shows us the importance of the Puritan legacy as it applies to important doctrinal and practical issues of our day. All Christians will benefit from knowing the Puritans. This book affords an excellent place to start.

Código: isin,Título: Indwelling Sin,Autor: John Owen,"Descrição: Indwelling Sin
 ranks high among Owen’s works, with rare insight into the experience of the Christian soul. The basis of the treatise is taken from Romans 7:21, where indwelling sin in believers is in the character of “a law,” whose seat is the heart and whose nature is enmity against God. Sin acts consecutively in withdrawing the mind from what is good, through positive opposition to God, by ensnaring the soul in captivity, and lastly by filling it with hatred to the principles of holiness. The power of indwelling sin is seen in its deceitfulness, developed in three stages using James 1:14-15: the mind is withdrawn from obedience; the affections are enticed; and actual sin is then committed. Its power in the believer’s soul is seen further by observing its effect in unregenerate persons, its resistance to moral law, and our fruitless attempts to subdue it in our own strength. Owen’s goal is that we become vigilantly watchful in consistently opposing sin and successful in waging war with sin through applying the sin-conquering truths of Christ’s gospel. Many consider this book (together with his 
Mortification of Sin
 and 
Temptation
) essential for Christians of all ages who desire to walk with the Lord in true biblical holiness.",Preço: 8.13,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/isin/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=isin&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=isin&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: sickfg,Título: Sickness,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: In this edition of the Broadcaster, entitled ""Sickness,"" J. C. Ryle introduces this important subject by declaring that sickness is universal, and he explains why that is so. Arthur W. Pink then describes the gift of health as priceless. Philip B. Power tells us how to apply God’s wonderful comforts in Christ to our sickbed. Do you use your time wisely while you are sick? Thomas Boston gives biblical reasons for how and why you should. A living author, Christopher Bogosh, has written an excellent book—Compassionate Jesus—calling Christians to rethink our approach to modern medicine. He tells us how to use God’s medicine—prayer. In a truly provocative article, John D. Wells reveals why the sickbed is not favorable for finding eternal life. Following that, Puritan George Swinnock reminds us of our biblical duty to visit and minister to the sick: it is not merely a pastoral work but an act that Christ will mention in the Day of Judgment! In a second article, Ryle asks hard questions and presses our consciences with biblical duties to help us prepare ourselves to honor Christ, examine ourselves before Christ, and commune with Christ in our times of sickness! Lastly, in my opinion, no uninspired writer brings the sweetness of Christ to the subject of sickness as beautifully as Charles Spurgeon. And he exhorts us, “If Jesus loves you, and you are sick, let all the world see how you glorify God in your sickness. Let friends and nurses see how the beloved of the Lord are cheered and comforted by Him.” Do we believe that?

Código: dadyfg,Título: Death and Dying,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: With hundreds of thousands of deaths in the wake of our worldwide pandemic, the shadow of the King of Terrors haunts the minds of people everywhere in the world. So, let us think about, talk about, pray about death. To urge you in that direction, we present the latest issue of the FGB: 
Death and Dying
. Christopher Bogosh introduces the subject by describing the three deaths found in Scripture: physical, spiritual, and eternal. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones tells us that, contrary to the modern view, the Bible clearly teaches that death is not the cessation of existence and that the human soul is immortal. Charles Spurgeon explains that death is our enemy, which entered human experience by sin; but Jesus Christ has conquered it! Christopher Bogosh then challenges the modern idea of brain death and gives us instead the testimony of God’s Word about death. Robert M’Cheyne tells us that the world fears death and what follows it; but our heavenly Father and the Holy Spirit declare, “Blessed are the dead.”  Do you think about death? Have you ever meditated on death? Thomas Boston explains meditation step-by-step and then gives a wonderful example of a meditation on death. Now, what if you died in your sins this year? Have you considered what you would lose in this world and in the world to come? Samuel Davies presses us to consider our eternal loss if we die in our sins. For many, preparing for death means a will and an insurance policy. But a third provocative and helpful article by Christopher Bogosh teaches us how to pray to prepare for death—praying for clear evidence of salvation, for renewing the inner man, and for being equipped by God to face death without fear. Christians are never surprised to learn that unbelievers fear death and are unwilling to die. But the same should not be said of believers! To our surprise, many believers seem to be unwilling to die. Thomas Brooks applies the Scriptures to move us, not only to be willing to die, but to heartily desire it! Last of all, death is a part, a terrible part, of God’s curse upon sin. Nevertheless, Octavius Winslow paints the preciousness of the believer’s death with such glorious strokes that our hearts are swept into breathtaking, majestic scenes of God’s love for us, God’s desire for us, God’s joy in us, and Christ’s triumph for us! Read prayerfully, it should make you pant for death and eternity with the resurrected Lord of glory! I am going to die. So are you. And our inescapable appointment is one day closer.

Edward Donnelly beautifully describes heaven itself as the place of God’s glory. Paul Helm shows us that, based on Scripture alone, heaven is redemptive, fixed, and final. Few people have ever had the great gift of describing the things of Christ with such beauty as did Charles Spurgeon. His vision of the Beatific Vision and the glory of seeing Christ should stoke the longing soul with living hope. Heaven, that place of God’s glory, is a world of love, says Jonathan Edwards—a place where we will, in love, all be filled with the fullness of God. Thomas Brooks picks up where Spurgeon leaves off, expanding on the glory of our experience with God the Father and Christ the Son: the best and choicest presence of God and Christ is reserved in heaven! Thomas Reade enriches our hearts with meditations on heaven. Meditate here, friend, and set your hearts on fire with the hope that lies before us. What is your vision of heaven? Is it robes, harps, and sitting on clouds forever? Derek Thomas paints a challenging biblical picture of the new heaven and the new earth. Edwards, in a second article, tells us how to seek that blessed world of love and how to avoid hell, the world of hatred.

Joel Beeke and Paul Smalley then give us an extended biblical explanation of election. Then, in a second article, Robert Purnell once again gives us a concise overview of reprobation. Following that, Lorraine Boettner unfolds the solemn biblical account of reprobation. How do election and evangelism work together. Southern Baptist Robert Selph explains this clearly and briefly—it is not as complicated as many make it. But how does one know if God has chosen him or her to everlasting life? Thomas Reade answers with verve, beauty, and encouragement. Lastly, Octavius Winslow shows us the glorious truth that all God’s people were chosen to be like Christ Jesus, our lovely and blessed Savior. What a glorious, encouraging, and thrilling thought! Whatever you think of these two doctrines, we pray that you will ponder them prayerfully and see the immensity of God’s amazing grace in Christ. “Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God” (Rom 11:22).",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/earefg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=earefg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=earefg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Beloved, Yet Afflicted
 
Just as Jesus allowed Lazarus to sicken and die to show His own glory by raising him from the dead, so our Lord often takes His own people through times of suffering to show them more of His own gracious care. This sermon by Spurgeon assures the believer that though God's children are often afflicted, they are as surely beloved. Even death is merely God's calling his loved ones home to Himself.

Código: provfg,Título: Providence,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: In this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster, you will discover the God Who is God—the God Who reigns over every atom in His spectacular universe. Benjamin Beddome introduces us to our Sovereign by showing how His great works of creation and providence are related. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones defines providence by examining its three elements—preservation, government, and concurrence. Then, Arthur W. Pink explains the meaning of the Godhood of God and why it is crucial for Christians to understand it in opposition to the dignity, power, and attainments of man. But what is providence like and from what does it arise, properly understood? William S. Plumer tells us that God’s providence is like God’s nature—holy, just, benevolent, wise, sovereign, stable, and irresistible! Pink then explains so beautifully that God rules everything—all inanimate matter, irrational creatures, human beings, and all angels, good and evil. How can such a lofty doctrine be practical to believers? Joel Beeke gives us sound answers from the infallible Scriptures and from the Puritans. To compliment those answers, Thomas Watson gives biblical instruction in the ways that our sovereign God works all things for good to His eternally loved people. There is one aspect of providence that especially thrills the heart of all believers: how God worked in His sovereign, powerful, and mysterious ways to bring them to saving faith in Christ and to everlasting life! John Flavel reminds us of that astonishing work and the surprising mercies of God’s grace! Lastly, Thomas Reade concludes our subject by filling our souls with a glorious vision of God’s absolute reign by Christ Jesus in our hearts.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/provfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=provfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=provfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Believers must realize that it always sets before us a choice between God’s Word and the serpent’s word. John Owen introduces us to the subject, explaining the evil of temptation, how it prevails, and the way to prevent it. Matthew Henry comments with great clarity on the serpent, the first woman, and the first temptation. J. C. Ryle tells us about our great Savior Jesus Christ and how He was tempted by the devil. Thomas Manton gives us much light on how the devil tempts. Does God have a design in temptation? John Newton knows that He does and biblically explains it to us. One of the problems Christians face is determining what leads us to sin; Jonathan Edwards instructs us in that vital skill. William Gurnall urges us to watchfulness because our enemy is ever awake and prowling. Thomas Brooks offers us a wonderful catalogue of helps against temptation, and then Charles Spurgeon encourages our souls with the great news that Christ Jesus has the power to help us in our seasons of temptation. To help us think clearly about this subject, Octavius Winslow gives us lessons from Christ’s temptations.

Código: castfg,Título: Church & State,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: The purpose of this FGB is to provoke you to think biblically about the subject of the church and state. You will hear from Lutherans, Presbyterians, and Particular (Reformed) Baptists—all of them struggling to answer church/state questions from the Word of God. We begin with Chapter 24 of the 1677/89 Second London Baptist Confession: “Of the Civil Magistrate.” Jean-Marc Berthoud explains two types of power: the magistrate and the church. John Calvin declares that God has ordained civil magistrates for humanity’s good. Pierre Viret discusses the three major forms of government: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy—which is best? R. C. Sproul explains that the essence of civil government is force. Is government authority absolute? H. Rondel Rumburg argues that it is delegated, not absolute power. He also discusses the Social Contract Theory. Christopher Goodman examines true obedience when facing civil or religious oppression. The important doctrine of the Lesser Magistrates has been forgotten by modern believers as well as unbelievers; but Matthew Trewhella teaches us its biblical importance. Building upon that doctrine, which the Reformers and Puritans held, we have extraordinary examples of it in the Magdeburg Confession, John Knox, and Isaac Backus—Lutherans, a Presbyterian Reformer, and a Baptist!

This enriching ordinance of God brings the believer into great familiarity with God, opens God’s heart to us, and fills our empty souls. Prayer obtains great things from God and is the very friendship of the soul with God.  But what is the heart of prayer? Is there an essence to prayer without which “all your lifting up, both of hands, and eyes, and voices, will be to no purpose at all”? Yes. And the God who hears prayer has left us plain instruction about the living essence, the beating heart, of prayer. John Bunyan finds the key in the Apostle Paul’s words: “I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.” He begins with a memorable definition of prayer. Then he explores the two great aspects of the heart of prayer: prayer with the Spirit, and prayer with the understanding.

Código: citofg,Título: Christ in the Old Testament,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: This new issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster is “Christ in the Old Testament.” J. C. Ryle opens this profound subject by explaining that the key to Bible knowledge is Jesus Christ. The articles that follow use Christ’s three-fold division of the OT: law, psalms, and prophets. Charles Spurgeon preaches the “first gospel” from the Law in Genesis 3:15, the gospel of the serpent’s doom! Likewise, George Whitefield reveals Christ to us in the account of Abraham’s obedient attempt to sacrifice Isaac. Christ’s sufferings were prophesied throughout the OT, and Jonathan Edwards shows us that in detail. William Plumer explains that we might see Christ where He is not and miss where He is in the Psalms if we interpret Scripture poorly. John Calvin then interprets Psalm 2 well to show us that Christ is the Son of God declared there. Matthew Henry takes us to Christ in the Prophets, beautifully mining Christ from the gold of Isaiah.  Charles Simeon also shows from Isaiah that God the Father called and commissioned Christ as His anointed preacher. Is the gospel really in the OT? The law, the psalms, and the prophets overflow with it: James Durham proclaims Christ and His gospel from Isaiah; George Whitefield turns to Jeremiah to draw our hearts to Christ our righteousness; and Richard Sibbes takes the majestic text of Malachi that shines with the glory of Christ the Sun of Righteousness. We close with Charles Spurgeon telling us that on the road to Emmaus, Jesus was the best of tutors, teaching  from the best of books, and explaining the best of subjects—His own Person and work.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/citofg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=citofg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=citofg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: consfg,Título: Conscience,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: This 
Free Grace Broadcaster
 is dedicated to the subject of the conscience. Arthur Pink introduces this vital subject by defining conscience and by describing it as our best friend or worst enemy. Richard Sibbes beautifully explains the nature of conscience and why God gave it to us. William Perkins helpfully lists the duties of conscience as giving testimony and judgment. Following that, William Fenner demonstrates that every person has a conscience and gives further reasons why God gave it to us. In a second article, Arthur Pink helps us understand that our conscience has been corrupted by sin, that it is only able to work according to the light that it has, and that its operations are faulty. John Flavel takes us deeply into the sin-burdened conscience, and what a journey that is! He writes of the burdensome sense of sin, the memories of our sin, and the condemnation of conscience. In his second article, William Fenner informs us that ministers must know the spiritual state of their flocks to properly minister the Word to the conscience of God’s people. Again, John Flavel reveals the misery of a conscience in hell—a damned conscience. Yes, friends, consciences will follow the lost to hell. Mercifully, in his third article, Pink takes us into the comforting realm of a good conscience: how do we obtain one, what are its characteristics, and how do we maintain it? J. C. Ryle than tells us that nothing in our gospel-war against sin is better calculated to quiet, soothe, and comfort a raging conscience than justification by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. Finally, Charles Spurgeon warns against using outward practices and a little bit of religion to quiet our conscience: that can be eternally deadly. As always, the joy of salvation and the heaven-on-earth of a peaceful conscience are found only in the finished work of Christ and the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/consfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=consfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=consfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Thomas Brooks helps us to see that strong saints must show Christlike, self-sacrificing love to weaker saints: do we practice self-denial in that way?

John Flavel reveals that the sins of God’s people and the ways those sins stumble others are a bag of poison cast by Satan!

Código: authfg,Título: Authority,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: This issue of the FGB presents the theme of Authority. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones announces our world’s desperate need of it. Stephen Charnock mines the Scriptures to display God’s absolute authority, and Jeff Pollard declares that God’s authority is revealed in the infallible, Spirit-breathed Word. In his second article, Dr. Lloyd-Jones takes up the subject of Christ’s authority manifested in His glorious Lordship. Benjamin Warfield describes how Jesus appointed His apostles, who lived and ministered with Him, to write the Gospels and the other New Testament writings. The Lord wanted His gospel call to salvation to spread throughout the world. Jean-Marc Berthoud teaches us about the importance of Christ’s authority in local churches. Now, do pastors, elders, and undershepherds have real authority in Christ’s churches? Arthur Pink clearly affirms and explains the necessity of such authority. In accord with this, elders have the responsibility of preaching God’s authoritative Word to Christ’s blood-bought people, ever setting the beauty and glory of His crucifixion and resurrection before them. Fathers too have authority, and Richard Baxter shows them how to use it to the glory of God and the good of their families. What about civil government? James Renihan shows us from Scripture and the 1689 Confession that magistrates are God’s authorized servants. Finally, C. H. Spurgeon blesses us with a moving declaration of Christ’s authority to save sinners!",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/authfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=authfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=authfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: pblofg,Título: Precious Blood,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: In this issue of the FGB, Precious Blood, Octavius Winslow introduces this glorious, soul-satisfying subject of Christ’s precious blood in the first of three articles. Thomas Brooks then shows us from Holy Scripture that the shedding of Christ’s blood was purposed in eternity but accomplished in history. Winslow then magnifies Christ Jesus as the Great High Priest, shedding His blood for His people and declaring, “The atoning blood of Immanuel is the divine bath of the soul.” The cleansing power of Christ’s blood is Stephen Charnock’s subject and shows, among other things, that it is the cause of our justification in God’s high court. In the same stream of holy, soul-elevating thought, John Flavel announces to the world that Christ’s precious blood has such great efficacy that by it God can forgive the greatest sinners! Charles Spurgeon adds that believers are not sanctified by the works of the law, but by the holy and precious blood that streamed from Jesus’ head, hands, and feet. In his second article, Thomas Brooks takes us to the throne of grace and shows us that our privilege of prayer was purchased by Christ’s blood. Spurgeon then magnifies Christ’s blood in the Lord’s Supper (meditating on this would be a great preparation for the next time you dine at Christ’s table!). Flavel then boldly proclaims that Jesus Christ is the only physician of sin-sick souls! O what a great Physician He is for the guilt stricken, sin-laden sinner! George Swinnock lifts our hearts to embrace and rejoice in regeneration, the Holy Spirit’s miracle purchased by Jesus’ precious blood. Closing this high, holy, and soul-rejoicing theme is Winslow’s third article: in it, he presses us with the impossibility of overestimating the value of Christ’s blood. O friends, delight your souls in the glorious truth of Christ’s precious blood—the purchase of our salvation.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/pblofg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=pblofg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=pblofg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: peacfg,Título: Peace,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: I often rise early in the quiet of morning to walk the streets of my neighborhood, praying for my neighbors. On one occasion, a man came out of his abode, and I struck up a conversation with him. I asked, “How can I be praying for you?” He answered, “Pray for world peace.” Here, I thought, was an open door to preach the gospel. I said, “I will be glad to pray for world peace, but that will only happen when the Prince of Peace reigns in every human heart.” I was not looking for a debate on end-times matters. I just wanted to tell him about the Prince of Peace, Who died on the cross at Golgotha as the sin-bearing Substitute of His people; the Prince Who rose again triumphantly the third day; the Prince Who secured eternal peace with God by shedding His blood for sinners. I wanted my neighbor to know that true peace came only by faith in Jesus Christ the Lord—peace with God and peace with others. His previous experiences with modern churches, however, left him uninterested. He smiled and went back inside his home. He was looking for another kind of peace.
 
Jesus spoke of two kinds of peace: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you” (Joh 14:27). The world offers seasons of peace—short seasons without war or calamities. Marxists, Islamists, New Agers, Globalists, and others promise worldwide peace. Of course, what they mean is that the world will be at peace when they rule it. Promised peace attracts diehard, even fanatical, devotees in vast numbers. But man’s depraved nature never has and never will bring lasting peace to this world. My neighbor will be disappointed with the peace the world offers.
 
In stark contrast to the failed human efforts for peace, anyone who repents of his sins and believes on the crucified and resurrected God-man Jesus Christ can and does know a peace with God that can never fade away. Consider Paul’s exhortation to the Philippians: “In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Phi 4:6-7). Peace that passes all understanding—Paul knew experientially about that peace, even as he wrote to the Philippian believers from prison. He knew, as God’s children know, that Christ’s peace cannot be taken from us. Arthur Pink illustrates that peace: “A tyrant once threatened a saint, ‘I will destroy your home’—you cannot destroy my peace. ‘I will confiscate your goods’—you cannot rob me of my peace. ‘I will banish you from your country’—I will take my peace with me.” O my friends, do you know that peace? Do you quiet your heart with Christ’s peace regardless of the providential experiences that come your way?

Is this your reason? Ah! Think for a moment, is it really true that you have no time to spare for them? Can you say so honestly before God? Will you be able to plead this with the Judge in the great day of account? Do you never attend meetings which take up more of your time? Or do you not waste more time idly, or in foolish company, than would be spent at the meeting? What? Have you time to eat, and to drink, and make merry, but none to pray? Have you time for business, for company, for folly, for pleasure, for lusts, for sin, but none for prayer? Have you time for the shop, the market, the ballroom, the card table, the public house, the political club—but none for prayer? You can spare days and weeks for the things of time. Can you not spare an hour for the things of eternity?""

Código: yadvfg,Título: Your Adversary,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: This issue of the FGB is about 
Your Adversary
, since every Christian needs to know who we are facing in this spiritual battle. Arthur Pink’s first article asks a question: Is the devil just a figment of our imagination? Pink answers that the Word of God gives conclusive evidence that the devil is real. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones gives us a biblical survey of the Bible’s teaching about our adversary the devil. In a second article, Arthur Pink gives us a clear and helpful biblical exposition of the personal characteristics and acts that prove the devil to be a real person. Thomas Manton reveals that Scripture tells the story of the raging war between Satan and God’s people down through the ages. Charles Spurgeon warns believers and urges them to realize that Satan watches and considers the weaknesses of believers; based on those weaknesses, he plans his temptations and attacks. Thankfully, Thomas Brooks then gives us ten helps against Satan’s devices and schemes. This is a wonderful list of stratagems against the adversary’s cunning tricks and traps. We also see how to resist the devil in William Perkins’ fictional dialogue between Satan and a Christian. Jonathan Edwards unfolds the extraordinary wisdom of God in the way He outwitted and overthrew our adversary. In his second article, Spurgeon gives us the ultimate weapon for overcoming Satan—the blood of Jesus Christ the Lamb of God. What a feast and encouragement for the beleaguered soul! And once again, Jonathan Edwards cheers and strengthens our hearts with knowledge that the days of our suffering physically and spiritually by the schemes and attacks of Satan will end with the adversary cast into the lake of fire for eternity. The last article in this issue leaves us with a warning about Satan’s devious, unrelenting warfare against the unity of Christ’s blood-bought people. O children of God, let us love one another as Christ loved us (Joh 15:12): let us not “bite and devour one another” (Gal 5:15), which is our adversary’s work; but let us exalt Christ and defeat our adversary by keeping “the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Eph 4:1-3).",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/yadvfg/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=yadvfg&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=yadvfg&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Charles Spurgeon describes the unity that Christ prayed for, contrasting it with man-made movements and denominations. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones then beautifully describes the spiritual nature of unity in Christ’s body. Following that, Anthony Burgess discusses the difference between visible and invisible unity. A second article by Lloyd-Jones lists helpful steps for guarding the Spirit’s unity among Christ’s people. Thomas Smyth offers us twelve rules for promoting harmony among church members, and another article by Anthony Burgess exhorts ministers to seek unity among themselves. The unity of pastors and members of Christ’s churches is important; Andrew Fuller guides in securing it. In his third article, Burgess expounds the excellence of unity and how it brings the world to believe the truth of Christ’s saving mercies. Spurgeon’s second article calls us to the crucial work needed in accomplishing Christian unity. We conclude with Jeremiah Burroughs explaining the excellence and beauty of peace, love, and harmony among the blood-bought people of God.

Pollard continúa explicando el evangelio en términos de los tres oficios de Cristo. Jesús vino como profeta para que el hombre pudiera conocer la voluntad de Dios. Él vino como sacerdote para ofrecerse a sí mismo un sacrificio por los pecados de su pueblo. Y vino como el rey soberano que otorga a su pueblo la fe y el arrepentimiento que llevan a la salvación.

Richard Adams, también predicador puritano, nos ofrece una perspectiva general de las cuatro gracias necesarias para tener hijos y nos ofrece un segundo artículo acerca de la mejor manera de animar y apoyar a la mujer embarazada.

Portavoz de la Gracia
 enfocando el tema de las Buenas Obras. Charles Spurgeon nos presenta el primer artículo preguntando si es posible que un pecador tenga obras. Seguidamente, David Martyn Lloyd-Jones nos muestra lo que dicen las Escrituras acerca de la relación entre la gracia de Dios, nuestras obras y la salvación en Cristo Jesús. Arthur Pink nos pregunta si estamos obteniendo provecho de nuestro estudio de las Escrituras o no, describiendo el lugar, la necesidad, la naturaleza y el alcance de las buenas obras. Horatius Bonar  muestra que la justificación únicamente por gracia a través de únicamente la fe en Cristo Jesús no produce un vivir superficial, mundano o indiferente, sino que es la motivación para un vivir santo evidenciado por las buenas obras. Luego aprendemos de Ebenezer Erskine cómo la fe en Cristo influencia y produce buenas obras. El puritano Thomas Manton es un poco más difícil de leer que algunos de nuestros otros autores, pero la lectura cuidadosa y devota de este artículo sobre ser celoso de buenas obras beneficiará ricamente al lector. Erskine nos ofrece un artículo más en el que declara con intrepidez la necesidad de mantenernos constantes en hacer buenas obras y lo que esto significa.

Pero como todos los hombres son naturalmente resistentes, ¿cómo los atrae el Padre? Según Spurgeon, Él envía al Espíritu Santo para cambiar los corazones de los hombres para que vengan voluntariamente al Salvador sin ninguna obligación. ¿Cómo se logra esto?

Charles Spurgeon, quien sabía muy bien lo que era sufrir, nos ofrece dos artículos extensos: en el primero, ofrece consuelo a los sufren distintos tipos de aflicciones; en el segundo, encara la pregunta: “Si Dios me ama, ¿por qué estoy sufriendo?”. James Buchanan nos enseña que la Biblia es un gran consuelo cuando sufrimos.  A esto le sigue una colección maravillosa de selecciones del libro The Mute Christian (El cristiano mudo) por Thomas Brooks. Por último, Octavius Winslow nos ayuda a comprender que el Señor Jesucristo es nuestra fuente de consolación.

Código: fttts,Título: De la tradición a la verdad,Autor: Richard Bennett,"Descrição: De la tradición a la verdad
 es el testimonio personal de Richard Bennett, sacerdote católico romano, en su peregrinaje de fe a través del testimonio del Espíritu Santo en las Sagradas Escrituras. Describe la fe bíblica y las dificultades subsiguientes, de una manera que resulta en una lectura iluminadora e instrucción vital para todos los que tienen que ver con tradiciones católico romanas.
Richard Bennett, oriundo de Irlanda, vivió veintidós años en la isla de Trinidad, en las Antillas; fueron veintidós años de servicio como sacerdote de una parroquia. Después de un grave accidente que casi le costó la vida en 1972, comenzó a estudiar seriamente la Biblia. Luego de casi catorce años de comparar el catolicismo con la fe bíblica, por la gracia de Dios y la convicción del Espíritu Santo, Bennett creyó en Jesucristo como su único Salvador. “Porque por gracia sois salvos por medio de la fe; y esto no de vosotros, pues es don de Dios;  no por obras, para que nadie se gloríe” (Efesios 2:8-9). Por lo tanto, en 1985, sabiéndose salvo por la gracia de Dios únicamente, dejó los hábitos y la iglesia católica. Valiéndose del internet, ha fundado un ministerio de evangelización, llamado Berean Beacon en www.bereanbeacon.org, dirigido al pueblo católico.
El ministerio pone un énfasis particular en la evangelización y la conversión del católico. El otro énfasis principal del ministerio es informar a los cristianos evangélicos acerca del catolicismo, valiéndose de conferencias con el uso de Skype, la distribución de literatura y DVDs.

Portavoz de la Gracia
 se titula 
El Día del Señor
. Ese día maravilloso es –o por lo menos debiera ser—una muestra de la gloria divina y del reposo eterno que le espera a todos los escogidos de Dios. ¡Qué bendición es que Dios haya ordenado las cosas de manera que una vez por semana, después de seis días de trabajo, tengamos un día dedicado a él, una séptima parte de nuestro tiempo, que pasamos gloriosamente con Aquel que nos ama y se entregó por nosotros!
Este número empieza con Arthur W. Pink, quien nos da un vislumbre del origen de tener seis-días-de-trabajo y un-día-de-reposo que Dios estableció en su obra todopoderosa de la creación. J. C. Ryle ofrece abundantes pasajes del Antiguo y del Nuevo Testamento que fortalecen y avalan el fundamento del séptimo día de reposo y el primer-día-de-la-semana como Día del Señor. Thomas Boston nos brinda una breve exposición del Cuarto Mandamiento, mientras que Benjamin B. Warfield establece un fundamento bíblico para la observancia del Día del Señor. ¿Por qué adoran al Señor los cristianos el domingo en lugar del sábado? Archibald A. Hodge nos ayuda a comprender el cambio bíblico e histórico del día de reposo al Día del Señor. Luego Ezekiel Hopkins nos presenta una breve ponencia sobre cómo le rendimos culto a Dios en 
público
, mientras que William S. Plumer nos enseña que nuestras obligaciones del Día del Señor incluyen al 
hogar
. Aparte de adorar a Dios en público y en el hogar, ¿qué tipos de obras debemos realizar el Día del Señor? Ezekiel Hopkins explica las obras de devoción, las necesarias y las de caridad. Thomas Case nos exhorta sabiamente a honrar al Padre, al Hijo y al Espíritu Santo en el culto el día de adoración. Y, para terminar, Jonathan Edwards pone en claro que el Día del Señor no nos fue dado para ser una carga, sino un tiempo de placer inestimable.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/ldayfgs/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ldayfgs&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ldayfgs&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: cdisfgs,Título: Disciplina eclesiástica,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: ¿Por qué tantas iglesias en nuestra cultura son tan débiles, impotentes, mundanas y cada vez más intrascendentes? David Martyn Lloyd-Jones nos da al menos una razón al preguntar: “¿Cuándo fue la última vez que oyó desde el púlpito cristiano alguna referencia al tema de la disciplina? ¿Con qué frecuencia ha escuchado sermones o mensajes sobre el tema? La palabra casi ha desaparecido, y lo que significa y representa ha caído en el olvido. Y, lamentablemente, no solo se descuida la disciplina, sino que hay muchos que aun tratan de justificar el que se la ignore”. Para una pequeña minoría, es como si Lloyd-Jones le estuviera dando un sermón a los que todavía se mantienen fieles en practicarla. Pero para muchos, es tan incomprensible como si estuviera hablando en otro idioma.
   Jesucristo dio a sus iglesias compradas con su sangre instrucciones positivas acerca de la disciplina eclesiástica: “Evangelio 1: Dios es santo. Todos hemos pecado, lo cual nos ha separado de Dios. Pero Dios envió a su Hijo a morir en la cruz y volver a la vida para que podamos ser perdonados. Todo el que cree en Jesús puede tener vida eterna. No somos justificados por las obras. Somos justificados solo por fe. ¡Por eso, el evangelio llama a todas las gentes a ‘sencillamente creer’! Un Dios que ama incondicionalmente nos acepta tal como somos. Evangelio 2: Dios es santo. Todos hemos pecado, lo cual nos ha separado de Dios. Pero Dios envió a su Hijo a morir en la cruz y volver a la vida para que podamos ser perdonados y comenzar a seguir al Hijo como Rey y Señor. Todo el que se arrepiente y cree, puede tener vida eterna, una vida que comienza hoy y se extiende por la eternidad. No somos justificados por las obras. Somos justificados solo por la fe, pero la fe que obra nunca está sola. Por eso, el evangelio llama a todas las gentes a ‘arrepentirse y creer’… [Un] Dios amante nos acepta contrariamente a lo que merecemos y luego nos capacita por el poder del Espíritu a llegar a ser santos y obedientes como su Hijo. Por medio de reconciliarnos con él, Dios nos reconcilia con su familia que es la iglesia, y nos capacita como pueblo suyo a representar unidos su propio carácter santo y trina gloria”
1
. En el contexto de una iglesia que predica el Evangelio 1, la idea de una disciplina eclesiástica puede parecer extraña, si no directamente contradictoria. Sin embargo, el evangelio divino de gracia transforma a las personas. El arrepentimiento por el pecado, la fe en el SEÑOR Jesucristo, el nuevo nacimiento y un nuevo corazón, la unión con Cristo y la gracia dada por Dios que produce una santidad que refleja a Dios son señales de vidas transformadas. En la congregación que comprende la gracia, el arrepentimiento, la fe, las vidas transformadas y el negarse a uno mismo, la disciplina eclesiástica es una expresión del amor de Cristo (Ap. 2-3). El amor a Cristo y los unos por los otros exige rendición de cuentas.
    En vista de esto, 
Portavoz de la Gracia
 enfoca la disciplina eclesiástica. R. Albert Mohler, Jr. presenta este tema crucial explicando las razones históricas y culturales por las que la disciplina eclesiástica ha desaparecido de las iglesias norteamericanas. Hezekiah Harvey luego define bíblicamente qué es disciplina eclesiástica. James Bannerman revela, basándose en las Escrituras, que la disciplina no se originó por tradición humana: fue instituida directamente  por Jesucristo, la Cabeza de la Iglesia. Después, John Gill nos instruye en las maneras bíblicas en que una iglesia admite a las personas o las excluye de su membresía. En un segundo artículo suyo, Mohler demuestra que la disciplina instituida por Cristo preserva la pureza visible de los que profesan el nombre del Cristo resucitado. Daniel Wray explica la necesidad de la disciplina, y a esto le sigue un tercer artículo por Mohler que describe las tres áreas vitales que requieren disciplina. ¿Cuáles son las modalidades de la disciplina eclesiástica? ¿Qué tiene la iglesia autoridad de hacer en este sentido? Daniel Wray responde a estas preguntas para nuestro beneficio. La excomunión es un tema difícil, y Jonathan Edwards detalla la naturaleza de esta severa disciplina. Nadie puede practicar esto en la iglesia sin encontrar objeciones. Wray nos da la respuesta a varias de las más comunes. Por último, Charles Spurgeon nos exhorta personalmente y como congregaciones de Jesucristo, a mantener pura a la iglesia del Señor.
    ¿Es esto realmente importante? Considere las observaciones profundas de Robert Murray M’Cheyne: “Cuando comencé la obra del ministerio entre vosotros, ignoraba totalmente la gran importancia de la disciplina eclesiástica. Creía que mi gran y casi único trabajo era orar y predicar. Consideré a vuestras almas tan preciosas y el tiempo tan breve que dediqué todo mi tiempo y cuidado y fuerzas a trabajar de palabra y doctrina. Cuando los casos de disciplina nos eran presentados a los ancianos y a mí, los encaraba con una especie de aversión. Era un deber que rehuía y puedo decir sinceramente que casi me llevó a dejar totalmente la obra del ministerio entre vosotros. Pero plugo a Dios, quien enseña a sus siervos de un modo distinto de lo que lo hace el hombre, bendecirme con casos de disciplina para la conversión manifiesta e indubitable de las almas de aquellos bajo nuestro cuidado. Y desde esa hora, se encendió una nueva luz en mi mente, y vi que si la predicación era una ordenanza de Cristo, también lo era la disciplina eclesiástica. Ahora estoy profundamente convencido de que las dos proceden de Dios, que Cristo nos confía dos llaves: la primera es la llave de la doctrina con la cual abrimos los tesoros de la Biblia; la otra llave es de la disciplina con la cual abrimos y cerramos el camino para sellar las ordenanzas de la fe. Ambas son dones de Cristo y ninguna de las dos puede ser descartada sin pecar”. La disciplina eclesiástica, como la dio Cristo, no es sentenciosa ni carece de amor—es parte del centro mismo de una vida cristiana santa. Quiera Cristo ayudarnos a vivirla.",Preço: 1.92,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/cdisfgs/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cdisfgs&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cdisfgs&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

De modo que se deduce que cualquier hombre que venga sabrá por su venida que ha sido elegido y capacitado por la gracia salvadora de Dios. Spurgeon concluye su sermón de la siguiente manera: ""Este día no he ensalzado la naturaleza humana, sino que la he humillado. Que Dios nos humille a todos. Amén"". Porque cuando el hombre es humillado Dios es glorificado.

 examina en detalle el mensaje moderno común a veces llamado ""fácil de creer"", donde se presenta la justificación en Cristo sin mencionar la responsabilidad de uno de abandonar el pecado y vivir separado del mundo. Este evangelio sostiene que uno puede ""tomar una decisión"" de ""recibir a Cristo"", sin inclinarse ante su autoridad sobre la vida de uno. El problema es que muchos concluyen: ""un pequeño pecado no dolerá; solo soy carnal, y Dios me ha salvado de cualquier manera"". Este falso evangelio deja al cristiano que profesa sin poder sobre el pecado y una falsa confianza en el cielo, incluso hasta el punto de resistir los llamados a arrepentirse porque “no necesito hacerlo; Ya estoy salvado ”. Romanos 6 se usa para desarrollar una comprensión bíblica de la negación propia, y los pasajes en 1 y 2 Timoteo se usan para explicar la naturaleza engañosa del pecado egoísta.

Código: siths,Título: Pecadores en las manos de un Dios airado,Autor: Jonathan Edwards,"Descrição: Edwards y el Gran Despertar
Según una tradición, no estaba programado que Edwards predicara en la capilla de Enfield el 8 de Julio [1741], pero lo hizo en sustitución de otro predicador. Aparentemente, el Gran Despertar no había llegado aún al distrito y reinaba allí una total indiferencia de que sucediera o no, tanto que cristianos de distritos vecinos habían dedicado casi toda la noche anterior a la oración, no fuera que “mientras las lluvias divinas sucedían todo alrededor”, no las hubiera en Enfield. Edwards tomó como su texto Deuteronomio 32:35: “A su tiempo su pie resbalará”, repitiendo un sermón que había predicado en su propia iglesia poco antes sobre el tema: “Pecadores en manos de un Dios airado”. [Eleazer] Wheelock reportó a [Benjamín] Trumbull cómo los presentes, que había caracterizado como “indiferente y presumida”, tanto habían cambiado antes de finalizado el sermón que se habían “humillado con una convicción tremenda de su pecado y peligro”. –Iain Murray, 
Jonathan Edwards: A New Biography
 (Edinburgo, Banner of Truth, 1987), 168.
La predicación por medio de la cual el espíritu de estupor fue abatido en la década de 1730, era escrutadora y convincente. Se estaba levantando un grupo de hombres para quienes la gravedad del pecado, la posibilidad de una profesión falsa de fe en Cristo y la indiferencia de un mundo perdido les era una carga apremiante. Detrás de sus declaraciones públicas estaba su visión de Dios y de la eternidad. Sus valles de humillación personal se habían convertido en valles de visión y, como dijera alguien que siguió en los pasos de Edwards siglos después: “Cuando los pastores captan una vista del valle de visión, y del abismo sin fondo en el cual cada hueso se va hundiendo, sienten que es importante advertir y alarmar a los pecadores, y solo entonces predican para muerte, predican para la eternidad, predican para el tribunal de Dios, predican para el cielo y predican también para el infierno”.—Ibid, 133.

Código: rwsws,Título: Razones por las cuales algunos no vendrán a Cristo,Autor: Albert N. Martin,"Descrição: “Y no queréis venir a mí para que tengáis vida.”
 
¡Seguramente éstas son unas de las palabras más trágicas que jamás se hayan dicho! Con ellas Jesús asevera claramente que la vida habría de encontrarse en Él, y que se obtendría sencillamente viniendo a Él. No estaba hablando de vida física, sino de la vida espiritual y eterna que uno recibe al unirse a Él por medio de la fe. Sin embargo, sus oyentes rehusaron hacer la única cosa necesaria para obtener la vida eterna, ya que rehusaron creer en Él. Y las palabras sobrias de Jesús demuestran que Él los considera a ellos —y a todos los que son como ellos— responsables por su indisposición obstinada de venir a Él.

Arthur Pink nos instruye con respecto al aspecto del pacto de la obra sustitutiva de Cristo. Spurgeon entonces explica magistralmente el Gran Intercambio: el pecado y la culpa del pecador creyente que se impone a Cristo; la justicia de Cristo sobre los pecadores creyentes. Pink luego explica con cuidado cómo la sustitución de Cristo es una obra penal. Octavius Winslow revela cómo la sangrienta sustitución de Cristo logró un perdón completo para su pueblo.

Tampoco pienso que podamos predicar el Evangelio a menos que lo basemos sobre la redención especial y particular de Su pueblo escogido y elegido, que Cristo llevó a cabo en la cruz.

Código: mappfgs,Título: Ropa modesta,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Este número de Portavoz de la Gracia es sobre Ropa modesta. Robert G. Spinney abre el tema, animando a todos los lectores a que piensen como cristianos cuando consideran cómo adornarse el cuerpo. Jeff Pollard intenta dar una definición de modestia cristiana basada en las palabras de Pablo en 1 Timoteo 2:9. Luego, Arthur Pink enfoca el pecado de hacer de la moda un “dios” al dar una exposición de la pregunta de nuestro Señor: “Y por el vestido, ¿por qué os afanáis? Nuestra ropa dice algo acerca de nosotros, ¿no es cierto? A veces habla claramente de nuestro orgullo. En un diálogo entre Hombresabio y Atento, Juan Bunyan nos enseña cómo podemos detectar el pecado del orgullo en nuestro vestuario. En el artículo más largo, el puritano Vincent Alsop nos da un poco de historia acerca de los orígenes de la ropa y nos aconseja cómo evitar ropa inmodesta. Robert Spinney luego nos presenta la relación entre el séptimo mandamiento y la ropa, revelando cómo podemos ser a veces cómplices del adulterio por lo que vestimos. Richard Baxter plantea el tema que muchos no tenemos en cuenta: nuestra manera de vestir revela nuestro corazón… En su artículo final, Spinney presenta un útil tratado sobre principios que sugiere de lo que es y lo que no es ropa apropiada y nos enuncia las categorías prácticas de “demasiado, demasiado poco, demasiado apretado”. Luego tenemos una exposición de Charles Spurgeon sobre las vestiduras reales que todos los hijos de Dios usarán en su santa presencia.

Todo lo que ha hecho Dios para salvar a su pueblo de sus pecados en la Persona y obra de su Hijo se resume en la palabra 
mediador
. Esta se refiere a las glorias del Cristo que es nuestro Profeta, Sacerdote y Rey. Cristo el Mediador era en un tiempo una expresión común entre el pueblo de Dios y un tema frecuente de sermones y libros entre los pastores.
El puritano Thomas Goodwin escribió un tomo entero sobre el tema. En cambio, esto no sucede en el cristianismo actual. En vista de esto, estoy considerando la posibilidad de dedicar un número entero en los próximos años a cada oficio de Cristo: Profeta, Sacerdote y Rey. ¿Para qué? Para que los hijos de Dios amplíen su comprensión de la gracia y el conocimiento de nuestro Señor. El anhelo de nuestro corazón es que todos nuestros lectores adoren y sirvan a Jesucristo con un fervor siempre creciente al disfrutar de su Persona y su obra.
De la misma manera, porque tantos predicadores leen el 
Portavoz
, ansiamos ver a una generación nueva de predicadores y maestros que proclamen las glorias de esta gran salvación a través del único Mediador entre Dios y los hombres, Jesucristo hombre. Quiera el Señor, nuestro Dios soberano, usar esto para inspirar a muchos de ustedes a predicar una serie sobre este tema  tan importante.
Abundan tantas obras excelentes del pasado, por lo que decidir qué artículos incluir fue realmente difícil.
Thomas Watson y Thomas Boston aportan excelentes introducciones al tema; Charles Spurgeon predica sobre la importancia vital de un Mediador y, página tras página, John Gill se explaya sobre la plenitud de Cristo el Mediador. De seguro que estos nombres son conocidos para la mayoría de nuestros lectores. En cambio, William Whitaker (1547-1595) puede ser nuevo para algunos. Su extenso sermón es virtualmente un curso de Cristología. Aunque a algunos nos parezca un poco técnico, su mensaje es digno de ser estudiado con cuidado.
Whitaker fue un teólogo famoso en su época, más conocido por su defensa de la Escrituras en su obra 
A Disputation on Holy Scriptures against the Papists
 (Una disputa con los papistas sobre las Sagradas Escrituras), especialmente Bellarmine y Stapleton. Según dicen, Bellarmine el jesuita tenía un retrato de Whitaker en su despacho.

Código: vwomfgs,Título: Feminidad virtuosa,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Entre las preguntas más cruciales y fundamentales registradas en la Palabra infalible de Dios está: “Mujer virtuosa, ¿quién la hallará?”. La pregunta misma destaca su escasez extrema. Y, como la mayoría de nosotros bien sabemos, más escasa, más valiosa: “Mujer virtuosa, ¿quién la hallará? Porque su estima sobrepasa largamente a la de las piedras preciosas.” (Pr. 31:10).
John Angell James contribuye con tres artículos a este número del 
Portavoz
: El primero describe la transformación y liberación de mujeres y culturas. El segundo revela que la misión de la mujer desde la creación no ha cambiado. Por último, el tercero testifica del poder relevante de la maternidad y da instrucciones provechosas, a fin de educar a nuestros hijos para Cristo. Charles Bridges pinta un retrato hermoso de la mujer virtuosa basado en Proverbios 31. Thomas Vincent presenta vívidamente a Cristo como el “mejor” esposo y llama a las mujeres jóvenes a desposarse con él. William Gouge lista cuatro gracias importantes que harán que la sumisión de la esposa honre a Cristo y luego da motivaciones excelentes con el fin de conmover su corazón para realizar esa buena obra. Algunas mujeres no tienen esposos ni hijos y W. K. Tweedie discurre sobre la obra extraordinaria que realizan para el Reino de Cristo. Jonathan Edwards ofrece consejos sabios a la mujer recién convertida con un breve extracto de unas de sus cartas. Y Jabez Burns culmina este

Código: gjuds,"Título: Juicio final, El",Autor: Carlos Spurgeon,"Descrição: El juicio final es una doctrina fundamental del cristianismo, y una de las más solemnes. En este folleto, Charles Spurgeon arroja luz bíblica sobre varios de sus aspectos. Al presentar su tema, muestra que el gran juicio sigue inmediatamente después de la resurrección de los muertos para que puedan ser juzgados en sus cuerpos. Continúa indicando, en primer lugar, que nadie escapa a esta contabilidad final, ya que cada persona que haya vivido será juzgada; en segundo lugar, que el juez no es otro que Jesucristo mismo; en tercer lugar, que la base del juicio consiste en aquellas cosas que se hacen en el cuerpo; y finalmente, describe el resultado: ""el Señor otorgará a su pueblo una recompensa abundante por todo lo que hayan hecho"" y al impío el castigo eterno debido a sus acciones pecaminosas. Spurgeon señala rápidamente que los justos no merecen ninguna recompensa, sino que ""Dios les dio gracia para hacer buenas obras, luego tomaron sus buenas obras como evidencia de un corazón renovado y luego les dió una recompensa por lo que habían hecho "". Lo resume todo de esta manera,"" ... pecado es infierno y santidad es cielo "". Y termina con una súplica apasionada:"" Oh, que tengamos gracia, cada uno de nosotros, para correr a Cristo.

Código: fworfgs,Título: Adoración familiar,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: ¿Adoración en familia? ¿
Tan
 importe es? La Asamblea General de la Iglesia de Escocia así lo creía. En 1647 publicó el 
D
irectorio del culto familiar
 el cual dice que “la Asamblea aún requiere de los ministros y ancianos gobernantes, y les insta a que hagan una diligente investigación en las congregaciones que tengan a su cargo, por si existe entre ellos alguna familia o familias que tengan por costumbre desatender este necesario deber; y si es hallada alguna familia, el cabeza de familia será, en privado, primeramente amonestado para corregir su falta; y, en caso de continuar en ella, ha de ser grave y tristemente reprobado por la sesión (de ancianos y ministros); después de la tal reprobación, si todavía es hallado descuidando el culto familiar, que sea, por su obstinación en tal ofensa, suspendido y privado de la Cena del Señor…” ¿Excomunión por no observar el culto familiar? Sea que coincidamos o no con esta disciplina tan severa, esta demuestra la gran importancia que las iglesias le daban a la adoración de Dios en la familia. Sabían que a lo largo de la historia de las iglesias de nuestro Señor, la adoración en familia ha sido el sostén principal de la prosperidad, salud y vitalidad del cristianismo. Nuestra oración ferviente es verla hoy restaurada en el pueblo de Dios.
Este 
Portavoz de la Gracia 
contiene más artículos que de costumbre, pero cada uno tiene su lugar. El Prefacio de la 
Confesión de Fe
 de 1677/1689 (conocida también como 
Segunda Confesión Bautista de Londres
 o simplemente la “1689”) llama enérgicamente a remediar el estado decadente del cristianismo de aquella época. Luego el puritano Oliver Heywood la declara como remedio para las iglesias y los hogares en decadencia. En dos artículos distintos, J.W. Alexander describe la naturaleza e historia de la adoración en familia y el rol importante del padre de familia en dirigirla. Tres artículos por el puritano Thomas Doolittle explican lo que Dios significa para la familia, la importancia de la Palabra de Dios y siete razones por las que la familia debe orar. El famoso historiador eclesiástico J.H. Merle D’Aubigne nos exhorta con cinco razones vitales para adorar a Dios en nuestros hogares. El puritano John Howe nos ayuda a comprender el papel de la mujer en la adoración familiar cuando el padre no está presente o no puede dirigirla. Dos artículos especialmente conmovedores por el misionero escocés John G. Paton demuestran la importancia vital de que los padres de familia dirijan a sus hogares en la adoración a Dios y el impacto extraordinario que lo tuvo no solo sobre él sino también sobre los caníbales entre los que trabajó en las islas del Pacífico Sur.

Código: fathfgs,Título: Paternidad,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Matthew Henry dijo: “Los jefes de familia, que dirigen los otros asuntos de la casa, deben también hacerlo con las cosas de Dios. Tienen que ser como profetas, sacerdotes y reyes en sus propias familias; y como tales, mantener el adoctrinamiento familiar, la adoración familiar y la disciplina familiar”. El jefe de la familia, en la época de Henry, realmente actuaba como cabeza del hogar, ya fuera como padre o como esposo. Los reformadores y puritanos se referían, a menudo, a los padres de familia como tales. La visión bíblica de la paternidad que surge de las páginas de las Escrituras es hermosa, majestuosa y santa. Es también muy extraña para la época en que vivimos.
Como destaca Henry, los padres deben dirigir su hogar en lo que respecta a las cosas de Dios. El perfil bíblico de un padre lo define como aquel que lidera a su familia de acuerdo con la Palabra de Dios. Él es el representante de Dios y Cristo. Esto significa que tiene que ser un hombre de oración, estudioso asiduo de la Palabra y de humilde santidad. Por su fe en Cristo, confiando en su gracia, dotado de poder por el Espíritu de Dios e informado por la Palabra, el padre debe inculcar y mantener la “doctrina familiar”. Esto significa que debiera ser capaz de enseñar a su familia las verdades de la Palabra de Dios. Debe practicar el “culto familiar”. Su hogar tiene que ser un lugar donde dirige a sus seres queridos en la adoración, del Trino Dios tres veces santo, en la oración, en la lectura de la Escrituras y en el canto. Y debe mantener la “disciplina familiar”. Esto significa que debe gobernar su hogar bajo Cristo, bendiciendo al obediente y castigando al desobediente; todo bajo la gracia, misericordia y el amor de Jesucristo el Señor. Debe aprender de Cristo, andar con Cristo y ser un modelo de la verdad de Cristo en su hogar.
¿Entendemos la paternidad de esta manera? Al igual que muchas otras doctrinas bíblicas, la de la paternidad está atravesando tiempos difíciles. Nuestra cultura decadente y perversa necesita una generación poderosa de padres de familia que se levante de las cenizas de autoritarismo, egocentrismo, feminismo y  toda clase de “ismos” que van en contra de los valores bíblicos necesarios para seguir a Cristo, cueste lo que cueste.
Con esto en mente, ofrecemos este número de Portavoz de la Gracia sobre 
la paternidad
. William Gurnall nos presenta este tema brevemente, describiendo las funciones de un padre como 
profeta 
para instruir a la familia,
 
un 
rey
 para gobernarla y un 
sacerdote 
para dirigir a la familia en la adoración a Dios. Arthur W. Pink luego nos ayuda a comprender que la paternidad es una responsabilidad y un privilegio. El padre cumple su papel al instruir a sus hijos, serles un modelo de la vida cristiana; disciplinándolos y orando por ellos. Juan Calvino explica la responsabilidad principal del padre. Richard Baxter escribe que, a fin de guiar correctamente a la familia para Cristo, el padre necesita la habilidad para gobernar, comprender lo que es la autoridad bíblica en su hogar y tener como un estilo de vida la santidad. Luego aprendemos de Nicholas Byfield que el padre tiene que ser piadoso. ¿Cómo se manifiesta esto? El autor nos lo dice dándonos una lista de señales que nos ayudan a identificar la obra de Cristo en sus corazones. Para ser “profeta” en su hogar, el padre tiene que enseñar la Palabra de Dios, dice Thomas Doolittle, y para ser eficaz en esa buena obra, él, como “sacerdote”, tiene que ser un hombre de oración. Cada padre de familia sabe que criar a los hijos en las enseñanzas de la Palabra, el amor y los consejos del Señor es una tarea difícil; por esta razón William Gouge escribe sobre la disciplina amorosa que el padre debe practicar como “rey” en su hogar. No obstante, Thomas Watson hace ver muy claro que los padres deben actuar con prudencia con sus hijos: de otra manera, pueden provocarlos a ira. Habiendo considerado todo esto, ¿qué pasos prácticos puede tomar el hombre para cumplir su papel? Richard Baxter comparte consejos claros, provechosos y bíblicos a los padres para que puedan reformar a sus familias en el nombre de Jesucristo. Por último, George Swinnock concluye este tema con una oración sincera y de corazón pidiendo al Señor que lo salvó que le ayude a ser el padre que ha sido llamado a ser.  
Si encuentra usted, bíblicos y provechosos estos artículos, por favor súmese a nosotros en orar que Dios el Padre quiera, por medio de la persona y obra de su Hijo y el poder de su Espíritu Santo, levantar a una generación poderosa de padres piadosos: Hombres que aman a Cristo, estudian su Palabra y están llenos de su Espíritu. Necesitamos hombres que amen a su esposa como Cristo ama a la Iglesia y que formen a sus hijos basados en las enseñanzas y los consejos del Señor. Padres comprados por sangre, llenos del Espíritu; nuestras familias los necesitan, nuestras iglesias los necesitan y nuestras comunidades los necesitan. Cuando nuestro bendito Padre celestial se propuso salvar a su pueblo perdonándoles sus pecados, cuando Cristo el Hijo vivió, murió y resucitó para salvarlos, y cuando el Espíritu Santo aplica su gran poder regenerador a sus vidas, no es que Dios esté solo redimiendo a pecadores, sino que estaba y 
está
 redimiendo también la paternidad.

Código: totfs,Título: Teologia de la Familia,Autor: Joel Beeke,"Descrição: Este libro presenta una perspectiva de la familia mayormente olvidada por la iglesia moderna. Incluye a cincuenta y seis autores. Cada uno da un testimonio poderoso que la iglesia del siglo XXI necesita para recordar lo que antes creía acerca de la vida familiar. Estos autores traen una medida de las correcciones y el bálsamo necesarios para curar nuestra amnesia y volver al orden bíblico.


La misión del editor de este libro, NCFIC, es “proclamar la suficiencia de las Escrituras para la vida de la iglesia y de la familia”. Cree que estas dos instituciones —iglesia y familia — son críticas a la proclamación del evangelio, la declaración de la gloria de Dios y la demostración del amor de Cristo de una generación a otra. En este esfuerzo por proclamar la suficiencia de las Escrituras, proporciona recursos, conferencias y maneras de conectar a las personas que anhelan saber lo que la Biblia dice acerca de la Iglesia y la familia.


Nosotros los editores, creemos que la solución del problema es arrepentimiento, fe en Cristo y reforma. Debemos confesar nuestros fracasos y rechazar las tradiciones no bíblicas de los hombres que hacen que la Palabra de Dios sea ineficaz.

Código: aborfgs,Título: Aborto,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Nuestro anhelo es llamar a todos los que leen este número de Portavoz de la Gracia a clamar a Dios por esta abominación que mancha nuestra tierra con sangre inocente. Queremos una comprensión renovada entre el pueblo de Dios de lo que es este acto criminal y nuestra responsabilidad con respecto a esta catástrofe inconcebible. Este número de Portavoz comienza con una breve exposición del Sexto Mandamiento —‘No matarás’—por el predicador puritano Ezekiel Hopkins. Seguidamente, Peter Barnes nos presenta sobriamente la realidad y los métodos horrorosos del aborto, agregando un examen provechoso de las enseñanzas de la Biblia sobre el tema. R. C. Sproul presenta una investigación sobre las enseñanzas bíblicas de la santidad de la vida. George Grant nos brinda una breve historia de la matanza infantil y nos muestra bíblicamente por qué  los seres humanos producen con tanta frecuencia culturas de muerte; nos muestra también que la vida tal como debiera ser origina en Jesucristo. ¿Necesita usted respuestas para los argumentos que presentan los defensores del aborto? Joel Beeke nos brinda respuestas bíblicas, científicas y sabias a los argumentos comunes de los que favorecen la decisión de una mujer de dar muerte a su criatura. Después de esto, R. C. Sproul examina las Sagradas Escrituras para responder a la pregunta crucial: ‘Cuándo comienza la vida?’ La Palabra de Dios enfoca claramente esta calamidad que azota a nuestra nación, y Joel Beeke nos presenta declaraciones bíblicas importantes sobre el aborto. Parece que son pocos los cristianos que de hecho ven una conexión entre el aborto y el paganismo; no obstante, Ed Payne nos da la conexión bíblica y advierte seriamente sobre el juicio de Dios sobre el sacrificio infantil.

Dios llama a su iglesia a adorarlo de acuerdo con sus mandamientos y el ejemplo apostólico, no nuestras buenas ideas. La historia, el contexto bíblico, la función y las limitaciones del principio regulativo se discuten en detalle. Si bien el pueblo de Dios a lo largo de la historia a menudo ha visto que el principio regulativo se enfoca en la adoración, este estudio demuestra que un enfoque más bíblico también enfatizará que la iglesia, su organización y sus funciones también deben ser cuidadosamente reguladas por las Escrituras.

John Owen, escritor de un libro penetrante y provechoso sobre el tema, nos da directivas claras sobre cómo mortificar al pecado. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones nos muestra que no lo podemos lograr sin el poder del Espíritu Santo. Nuestra falta de atención a la mortificación acarrea muchos y grandes peligros; Ezekiel Hopkins, quien también escribió una obra importante sobre el tema, nos advierte de esos peligros. Ralph Erskine nos ayuda a discernir la diferencia entre la mortificación legal y la del evangelio.

Código: gepufgs,Título: El propósito eterno de Dios,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: A fin de que el pueblo de Dios piense profundamente en estos temas, presentamos este número de Portavoz de la Gracia:  El propósito eterno de Dios. No todos los autores incluidos concuerdan  entre sí en todos los detalles; los lectores  diestros en asuntos teológicos lo notarán acá y allá. Pero todos estos autores —protestantes o bautistas— creen que el propósito eterno de Dios es el fundamento de la totalidad de nuestra salvación. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones introduce este tema sumamente profundo. Charles Spurgeon luego explica hermosa y conmovedoramente las partes, estipulaciones y los objetivos de los concilios eternos de Dios. ¿Cuál es la naturaleza de este acuerdo eterno? Patrick Gillespie lo describe, y Peter Bulkeley ofrece una breve lista de las promesas y los acuerdos tomados entre el Padre y el Hijo en la eternidad. La realidad bíblica del plan de Dios es explorado por R. B. C. Howell, y A. W. Pink muestra la importancia de la elección de Cristo como nuestro Mediador. Ahora bien, ¿es esto pura especulación o hay algún valor práctico en contemplar este tema? Thomas Brooks contesta esa pregunta con una exposición detallada de los acuerdos entre el Padre y el Hijo, que apunta a edificar y alentar al creyente. A. A. Hodge nos ayuda a ver que la única manera de comprender correctamente la expiación de Cristo es a través del cristal del propósito eterno de Dios. Y después, tenemos un segundo artículo en el que Spurgeon nos da una visión impresionante de la consumación del plan de Dios: la boda del Cordero.

Código: revifgs,Título: Avivamiento,Autor: Horatio Bonar,"Descrição: Ofrecemos este número de Portavoz de la Gracia sobre Avivamiento. Horatius Bonar apasionadamente introduce el tema y lo define. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones, quien predicaba, escribía y oraba intensamente por un avivamiento, nos da los motivos del corazón que debemos cultivar para que haya un despertar espiritual. Spurgeon nos instruye sobre las maneras bíblicas de prepararnos para recibir tal bendición del bondadoso Dios. James W. Alexander nos insta a orar por un derramamiento del Espíritu de Dios y Robert Murray M’Cheyne describe esa poderosa obra. Luego, Spurgeon nos exhorta con ardor a suplicar que Dios demuestre su poder soberano y transformador. ¿Qué clase de hombres usa Dios para un avivamiento? Bonar, con visión y experiencia personal, describe la clase de hombres que nuestro Señor usa. No obstante, anhelar avivamientos y predicar sobre avivamientos no basta. Tenemos que predicar verdades eternales reales acerca de la Persona y obra de Jesucristo, nuestro Salvador crucificado y resucitado. William Reid, editor de un libro sobre los avivamientos que se extendieron por el Reino Unido, describe el tipo de predicación doctrinal que tenemos que declarar a hombres y mujeres si hemos de ver que Dios obre. Lloyd Jones nos sacude la conciencia sobre la importancia de predicar la justificación y regeneración como imprescindibles para la conversión de las almas. Por último, Jonathan Edwards, el hombre que fue un instrumento poderoso en avivamiento, nos ofrece un recuento de primera mano de cómo se manifiesta el inmenso poder transformador de Dios en un avivamiento.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/revifgs/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=revifgs&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=revifgs&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

En la providencia de Dios en este mundo, la enfermedad es buena porque les recuerda a los hombres la muerte, les hace pensar en Dios, ablanda sus corazones, nos humilla ante Dios y pone a prueba nuestras profesiones de fe. Dado que la enfermedad proviene de la mano sabia y buena de Dios, incluso en un mundo tan pecaminoso como el nuestro, debemos responder a la enfermedad preparándonos para encontrarnos con Dios, soportar pacientemente la enfermedad que nos llega y ayudar a nuestros semejantes. ¿Qué harás cuando caigas enfermo? ¿Te quejarás? ¿O buscarás el consuelo del alma, así como la curación física, del Gran Médico de las almas?

Código: ssals,Título: Una poderosa Salvación,Autor: Carlos Spurgeon,"Descrição: Estos sermones, predicados por el Príncipe de los Predicadores, Charles Haddon Spurgeon, forman la colección 
Una poderosa Salvación
, con la cual pretendemos llevar a todos los lectores una herramienta para entender la Doctrina de la Salvación, incluida en ella, una magistral exposición acerca del Libre albedrío y las Doctrinas de la Gracia, como se les ha llamado históricamente.
 
Las Doctrinas de la Gracia, conocidas en inglés por su acróstico TULIP (Total depravity; Unconditional election; Limited atonement; Irresistible grace or effectual calling y Preservation of the saints) son la base de la fe reformada: 
 
1. Depravación total o Incapacidad humana
: La total pecaminosidad del hombre para buscar a Dios y hacer el bien según Él.
 
2. Elección incondicional
: La elección soberana incondicional de Dios para salvar a particulares pecadores indignos. 
 
3. Redención particular o Expiación limitada
: El sacrificio expiatorio eficaz de Cristo por los pecados de su pueblo. 
 
4. Llamamiento eficaz o Gracia irresistible
. Por lo cual, aquellos que Dios ha escogido para salvación vendrán indefectiblemente a Cristo, a través del llamado del Evangelio, pues es Dios quien los lleva a creer. 
 
5. Perseverancia o Preservación final de los santos
: Su pueblo, aquellos que han sido escogidos, llamados y justificados, también son guardados o preservados en la fe para que perseveren en la obediencia hasta el final de sus vidas por el poder de Dios; para que crezcan continuamente en santificación y estos nunca se perderán para siempre ni se apartarán para apostasía. 
 
Es el propósito de este libro entonces, que el lector pueda reconocer la inmensa gracia que Dios ha tenido para con nosotros al darnos un poderoso Salvador.",Preço: 3.95,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/ssals/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ssals&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=ssals&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM
Código: rdepfgs,Título: Depravación radical,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Ofrecemos este número de Portavoz de la gracia: 
La depravación radical
. Arthur Pink nos introduce a este pesado tema haciendo la pregunta: ""¿Es el hombre una criatura total y completamente depravada por naturaleza?"" Thomas Reade luego nos cuenta sobre las consecuencias mortales y los frutos amargos de la caída de Adán: en Adán todos mueren. Luego consideramos la útil encuesta de Joel Beeke sobre la doctrina de la depravación humana. Un segundo artículo de Thomas Reade nos lleva a una dolorosa verdad: el corazón del hombre es malvado. Pero él no nos deja allí: nos lleva al bendito Hijo de Dios para su liberación. John Owen describe con gran claridad el estado depravado y corrupto de la mente del hombre y nos enseña que el único remedio para esta gran oscuridad es el nuevo nacimiento: ""Debes nacer de nuevo"". Loraine Boettner explica el alcance y los efectos del pecado original, lo que resulta en la incapacidad humana en los asuntos de la salvación. ¿Cuál es nuestra verdadera condición espiritual fuera de Cristo? Charles Spurgeon declara que estamos legal, espiritualmente y eternamente muertos. ¡Sin embargo, también nos dice que podemos estar legal, espiritualmente, eternamente vivos por la fe en Jesucristo el Hijo! Luego escuchamos de John Flavel que en misericordia, gracia y amor, Dios atrae a los pecadores a Jesucristo, de manera gradual, adecuada, poderosa, efectiva y finalmente. ¡Eso sí que es una buena noticia! J. C. Ryle cierra nuestro tema haciendo una pregunta penetrante: ""¿Estás vivo o muerto?"" Cada uno de nosotros, queridos lectores, debemos responder a esa pregunta. Debes. No podemos cambiarnos a nosotros mismos; otros no pueden cambiarnos; pero Dios Todopoderoso puede. Hace que las almas muertas vivan por medio de Jesucristo. ¡Oh, predicalo, pastores! ¡Créanlo, lectores! ¡Proclamemos la vida eterna en Jesucristo a corazones radicalmente depravados en todo el mundo!",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/rdepfgs/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=rdepfgs&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=rdepfgs&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: tgodfgs,Título: El Dios Trino,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Presentamos este número de Portavoz de la Gracia: 
El Dios Trino
. Tocar este tema es pisar suelo santo, uno que no podemos tomar con ligereza. Esta doctrina constituye la verdad fundamental de nuestra fe y por lo tanto requiere lectura y estudio paciente y cuidadoso. Podemos declarar el corazón de la doctrina usando la sencilla frase de Calvino —“en la esencia única de Dios hay una trinidad de personas”— pero comprender las profundidades de nuestro Creador y Soberano infinito y santo escapa a nuestra capacidad humana. Por eso hemos tratado de ofrecer artículos comprensibles, agregando abundante información técnica en las notas de pie de página para los que quieran profundizar en el tema.
 
Loraine Boettner nos presenta este tema majestuoso contemplando la inconmensurable altura, profundidad, extensión y alcance del misterio del Trino Dios, destacando que es la marca distintiva del cristianismo. William S. Plumer luego nos da una provechosa perspectiva general de los temas fundamentales relacionados con la Trinidad. Acto seguido, Wilhelmus á Brakel nos adentra significativamente en el misterio, explicando el concepto de tres personas dentro de una esencia. Boettner nos ayuda luego con dos artículos más —una exposición comprensible de la doctrina misma, seguida por el tema controversial del orden y la subordinación dentro de la Trinidad. A. W. Pink nos ayuda a ver que esta doctrina es la base de toda enseñanza del Nuevo Testamento. Y, a pesar de su profundidad y dificultad, á Brakel nos explica por qué es esta doctrina realmente beneficiosa para el pueblo de Dios. Esto lleva a la discusión de John Owen sobre la comunicación de cada miembro de la Santísima Trinidad: Padre, Hijo y Espíritu Santo. Por último, Charles Spurgeon se aboca a corregir la idea errada de que Jesucristo es nuestro Salvador a exclusión de Dios el Padre y Dios el Espíritu Santo. Su intención es que comprendamos que el perdón de nuestros pecados y el don de vida eterna son totalmente trinitarios.

Código: sogos,Título: La soberanía de Dios,Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: “Las condiciones actuales piden a gritos un nuevo examen y una nueva presentación de la omnipotencia de Dios, la suficiencia de Dios, la soberanía de Dios. Desde cada púlpito en la tierra, es nece-sario proclamar con voz tronante, que Dios todavía vive, que Dios aún observa, que Dios todavía reina. La fe está ahora en el crisol, está siendo probada por el fuego, y no hay un lugar de descanso fijo y suficiente para el corazón y la mente, sino en el Trono de Dios. Lo que se necesita ahora, más que nunca, es una presentación constructiva, positiva y completa de la Divinidad de Dios”.

Código: sickfgs,Título: La enfermedad,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Le ofrecemos esta edición de Portavoz de la Gracia cuyo tema es “La enfermedad”. J. C. Ryle presenta este importante tema declarando que la enfermedad es universal, y explica por qué. Luego Arthur W. Pink describe al don de la salud como un bien inapreciable. Philip B. Power nos dice cómo aplicar a nuestra enfermedad las maravillosas consolaciones de Dios en Cristo. ¿Usa usted sabiamente el tiempo cuando está enfermo? Thomas Boston nos da las razones bíblicas para qué y por qué hacerlo. Christopher Bogosh, autor contemporáneo, llama a los cristianos a replantear nuestro concepto de la medicina moderna. Nos explica cómo usar el medicamento de Dios: la oración. En un artículo realmente sugestivo, John D. Wells, revela por qué el lecho del enfermo no es favorable para encontrar la vida eterna. Luego, el puritano George Swinnock nos recuerda nuestro deber bíblico de visitar y ministrar a los enfermos: ¡no es el deber solo del pastor sino una acción que Cristo mencionará para todos en el Día del Juicio! En un segundo artículo, Ryle hace preguntas difíciles y apela fuertemente a nuestra conciencia respecto de los deberes bíblicos que nos corresponden a fin de ayudarnos a estar preparados para honrar a Cristo, examinarnos a nosotros mismos ante Cristo y a tener comunión con él en nuestros tiempos de enfermedad. Por último, en mi opinión, ningún escritor sin inspiración incorpora la dulzura de Cristo al tema de la enfermedad con tanta belleza como Charles Spurgeon. Y nos exhorta diciendo: “Si Jesús te ama y estás enfermo, deja que todo el mundo vea cómo glorificar a Dios con tu enfermedad”. ¿Lo creemos? De hecho, Dios usa la enfermedad para bien del perdido y en su pueblo para su gloria. Cristo ama a su pueblo, especialmente en sus tiempos de enfermedad. Oramos que durante este tiempo extraordinario de padecimiento en nuestro mundo, encuentre usted en este PORTAVOZ una guía bíblica y segura que lo lleve al arrepentimiento y para honrar a Cristo en nuestros tiempos de enfermedad. ¡Sea su lecho de enfermo un lugar santo de comunión con Jesucristo el Gran Médico!

J. C. Ryle nos da una introducción al significado de la cruz. El autor alemán F. W. Krummacher comienza con los eventos inmediatamente anteriores a la crucifixión y enseguida hace una descripción conmovedora y profunda de los sufrimientos en cuerpo y alma de Cristo. Es ciertamente este un artículo digno de meditar. El horror de la crucifixión de Cristo revela lo nefasto de nuestro pecado: Cristo en la cruz es el pago por todos nuestros crímenes contra el cielo. S. Duytsch, autor del que no hemos podido encontrar información biográfica, nos da una exposición completa de la razón por la cual el apóstol Pablo se gloriaba en la sangrienta cruz de Cristo. Luego nos remontamos a los 1600s y a Thomas Adams, quien pinta un cuadro vívido y poderoso en una reseña de la pasión de Cristo. Es un cofre de tesoros para el alma que ansía comprender el sacrificio de su Salvador. Por último, Charles Spurgeon expone la doctrina de la sustitución para ofrecer al pueblo de Dios un festín de nutritivo alimento.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/cutcfgs/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cutcfgs&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=cutcfgs&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Código: incafgs,Título: Encarnación,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: En este número de Portavoz sobre Encarnación, J. C. Ryle da una explicación provechosa, clara y bíblica de lo fundamental en cuanto a la encarnación de Cristo. John Flavel nos ofrece luego un vislumbre extraordinario de la gloria de Cristo antes de su encarnación; la gloria y relación de amor que tenía con su Padre celestial antes de que comenzara el mundo. Demasiados cristianos en la actualidad piensan en la Encarnación solo en términos del niñito en el pesebre, sin relacionarlo con el propósito eterno de Dios—sus consultas y decretos. A. W. Pink nos ayuda a vencer esa miopía. Mientras estamos en el tema de la preencarnación de Cristo, Lorraine Boettner nos da una provechosa reseña de ciertos pasajes que enfocan la existencia de Cristo antes del tiempo: Jesús hizo muy claro el hecho de que su existencia no comenzó sencillamente cuando nació en Belén. Y Belén pequeña fue el punto preciso en que el propósito eterno de redención de Dios se convirtió en una realidad histórica. Horatius Bonar nos dice que “Belén es donde comienza la historia”. ¿Lo creemos? Thomas Boston nos ayuda a entender el nacimiento de Cristo: la concepción virginal, la santificación de la naturaleza humana de Cristo, la unión de la humanidad con la Deidad en la persona de Cristo y por qué Jesús tenía que nacer de una virgen. La doctrina gloriosa de la Encarnación se va desplegando a medida que William S. Plumer describe el evento más grande que jamás sucedió; Dios se hizo hombre. Con un segundo artículo John Flavel explica la humillación necesaria del Hijo eterno de Dios —su naturaleza, niveles y duración— mostrándonos que tenía que ser grandemente humillado antes de ser grandemente exaltado.

Código: tfypfgs,Título: Pensamientos para los jóvenes,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: En este número del Portavoz de la Gracia, Archibald Alexander presenta nuestro tema con un excelente consejo bíblico para los jóvenes. Plantea una importante colección de pensamientos desde la necesidad de un carácter consistente hasta la preparación para la muerte. Después de esto, J. C. Ryle da otra colección de exhortaciones reflexivas y provocativas, enfocándose en la necesidad de una persona joven de entender el pecado, el Salvador, la oración y la Palabra de Dios, además de ser cautelosos en la elección de amigos. John Angell James advierte a los jóvenes acerca de los pecados de su época, que no son diferentes de los pecados de los jóvenes de nuestros días. El apóstol Pablo instruyó a Tito a exhortar a los jóvenes a ser sobrios (Tito 2:6). A la luz de esto, Matthew Henry brinda persuasiones bíblicas, aleccionadoras y alentadoras para que los hombres y mujeres jóvenes cultiven la sobriedad. ¿Qué casa puede soportar peleas constantes entre hermanos y hermanas? ¿Cómo deben tratarse los hermanos? John Angell James brinda una discusión útil sobre este asunto. El puritano Tomás Vicente exhorta con fervor a los jóvenes que profesan la fe en Cristo a ser firmes y no desviarse. Explica sabiamente los motivos y da instrucciones para evitar la declinación y la apostasía. Con una prédica característica centrada en Cristo, Charles Spurgeon exhorta a los jóvenes a que dejen de poner excusas y crean en Cristo Jesús para vida eterna.

Con eso, Charles Spurgeon presenta este tema con una vista panorámica provechosa sobre la importancia, la práctica y los beneficios de la meditación bíblica. Thomas Watson define lo que es. Thomas Manton tiene la convicción de que es un deber bíblico y nos dice por qué. ¿En qué radica la naturaleza de la meditación? Isaac Ambrose responde y describe el tiempo, lugar y tema de esta práctica santa. William Bates nos instruye hermosamente en la meditación ocasional enfocada en la creación de Dios y George Swinnock ofrece cinco descripciones de la solemne y deliberada meditación sobre temas sagrados. ¿Existen peligros reales en descuidar este acto santo de pensar profundamente? ¡Edmund Calamy lista doce!

 para ayudarnos a evaluar nuestro propio estado espiritual.A. W. Pink presenta el tema de la apostasía y la define bíblicamente. Charles Spurgeon nos da muchas razones por las cuales algunos abandonan a Cristo. Ebenezer Erskine nos ayuda a ver la diferencia entre una apostasía parcial y una total. Siempre aparece Hebreos 6:4-6 cuando surge el tema de apostasía. Pink nos da una exposición clara y provechosa de este importante pasaje. En un segundo artículo, Erskine nos enfrenta con lo vil de la apostasía y ofrece aliento para ayudarnos a evitarla. En un sermón realmente penetrante, Samuel Pierce enfoca a los que se apartan de las iglesias de Cristo. Thomas Brooks describe siete características de maestros apóstatas con el fin de ayudarnos a identificarlos y evitarlos. Pueden ser individuos los que se apartan, pero también pueden hacerlo iglesias enteras. Horatius Bonar nos ayuda a reconocer a las iglesias que están haciendo un naufragio de la fe.

. El pueblo de Dios necesita que esta bendita y alentadora verdad llegue a sus corazones. Es realmente alimento para el alma hambrienta del creyente. Charles Spurgeon abre el camino enseñándonos la importancia de la resurrección como una verdad del evangelio. Incluso en sus tiempos muchos estaban desviando o distorsionando esa doctrina esencial. J. C. Ryle destaca el gran contraste entre el hecho de la resurrección y la 
lentitud
 de los discípulos en creerla. Albert N. Martin luego nos presenta cuatro verdades acerca de la resurrección de Cristo de entre los muertos que magnifica su gloria y esplendor. ¿Cuáles son las evidencias de la resurrección de nuestro Señor?

George Whitefield, poderoso predicador del Gran Despertar, explica el poder de la resurrección en el alma del cristiano, y David Martyn Lloyd-Jones demuestra la conexión crucial entre la resurrección de Cristo y la vida diaria del creyente. Para terminar, Charles Spurgeon tiene la última palabra sobre este tema glorioso: ¡nos dice que Cristo fue el primero en resucitar y que por eso, la resurrección del creyente está garantizada! ¡Alabemos el nombre del Señor!

Código: dochfgs,Título: La deidad de Cristo,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Presentamos el último número del Portavoz de la Gracia: La deidad de Cristo. Se presentaron numerosos desafíos al reunir estos artículos. Algunos de los artículos más completos de las teologías sistemáticas son altamente técnicos y, lamentablemente, ¡a menudo, secos como el polvo! Un tema tan glorioso, debería llenar nuestros corazones de asombro, alabanza y adoración, en lugar de ser un somnífero para una noche de insomnio. Por otra parte, los artículos más amenos, no siempre trataban a fondo, las profundas cuestiones que han surgido a lo largo de los siglos en relación con este controversial y profundo tema. La resolución fue encontrar artículos legibles y trasladar la información técnica a las notas a pie de página; por ello, nuestros lectores encontrarán más notas de pie de página de lo habitual. El tema era y es, demasiado vasto y profundo para abarcarlo bien en cuarenta y ocho páginas, por lo que este Portavoz es, simplemente, un abrebocas. No obstante, rogamos de todo corazón que el lector vea algo de la gloria y la belleza del Verbo hecho carne, a medida que se desarrollan estas páginas.El puritano Isaac Ambrose, introduce este Portavoz declarando que no se puede encontrar un tema más excelente para hablar o escribir que la persona de Jesucristo. A continuación, Charles Hodge nos ofrece un breve repaso de la enseñanza del A.T. sobre la deidad de Cristo. Otro puritano, Thomas Brooks, demuestra la deidad de Cristo, examinando los honores debidos a Dios que los escritores bíblicos otorgan a Jesús. Octavius Winslow examina los atributos y los nombres de Dios que los escritores bíblicos aplican a Cristo. A continuación, W.G.T. Shedd inspecciona las obras de Dios que también se atribuyen al Señor Jesucristo. Juan 1:1 es el campo de batalla, en donde la exposición de A. W. Pink nos ayuda a ver la gloriosa deidad de nuestro Señor en él. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones ofrece un estudio muy útil de los argumentos más importantes para entender correctamente la deidad de Cristo, tal como se presenta en Romanos 9:4-5. Finalmente, Charles Spurgeon tiene la última palabra. Atrapado por la asombrosa verdad de que Dios se hizo hombre para salvar a los pecadores, Spurgeon hace un llamado ferviente y urgente a hombres, mujeres y niños para que crean en el Dios-hombre para el perdón de los pecados y la vida eterna.",Preço: 1.78,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/dochfgs/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dochfgs&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=dochfgs&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Charles Spurgeon, quien nos ofrece tres artículos en este número, comienza el primero, considerando profundamente la insensatez, la miseria, la culpa y el peligro de los pecados ocultos. Thomas Brooks ofrece una mirada penetrante sobre el modo en que los pecados secretos erosionan y destruyen la oración, nuestra arma espiritual más poderosa. Spurgeon explica luego, dos maneras de cubrir el pecado —las del hombre y la de Dios—. Edward Payson nos lleva en un impresionante viaje al trono del Dios tres veces santo en el cielo y nos da una asombrosa visión de nuestros pecados secretos desde la perspectiva de Dios. Seguidamente, Jonathan Edwards nos ofrece una aleccionadora exposición de los pecados secretos, puestos al descubierto en el Día del Juicio. A continuación, Spurgeon hace una súplica urgente y sincera para que aquellos que están en pecados secretos, huyan a Cristo Jesús, de sus prácticas condenables. Finalmente, Octavius Winslow aclara, abundantemente, que si queremos una visión honesta del horror de nuestros pecados y si deseamos un corazón verdaderamente arrepentido, una sola visión despertará, eficazmente, nuestros corazones —Cristo crucificado—.

Código: citofgs,Título: Cristo en el Antiguo Testamento,Autor: J. C. Ryle,"Descrição: Este nuevo número del Portavoz de la Gracia es “Cristo en el Antiguo Testamento”. J. C. Ryle abre este profundo tema explicando que la clave del conocimiento bíblico es Jesucristo. Los artículos que siguen utilizan la triple división de Cristo en el A.T.: Ley, salmos y profetas. Charles Spurgeon predica el “primer evangelio” de la Ley en Génesis 3:15, ¡el evangelio de la perdición de la serpiente! Del mismo modo, George Whitefield nos revela a Cristo en el relato del obediente intento de Abraham de sacrificar a Isaac. Los sufrimientos de Cristo fueron profetizados en todo el A.T. y Jonathan Edwards nos lo muestra en detalle. William Plumer explica que, si interpretamos mal las Escrituras, podemos ver a Cristo donde no está y perdernos donde está en los Salmos. Juan Calvino entonces, interpreta bien Salmos 2 para mostrarnos que Cristo es el Hijo de Dios allí declarado. Matthew Henry nos lleva a Cristo en los Profetas, extrayendo bellamente a Cristo de la mina de oro de Isaías. Charles Simeon también muestra a partir de Isaías que Dios Padre llamó y comisionó a Cristo como su predicador ungido. ¿Está realmente el Evangelio en el Antiguo Testamento? La ley, los salmos y los profetas rebosan de él: James Durham proclama a Cristo y su Evangelio a partir de Isaías; George Whitefield recurre a Jeremías para atraer nuestros corazones hacia Cristo, justicia nuestra; y Richard Sibbes toma el majestuoso texto de Malaquías que brilla con la gloria de Cristo, el Sol de Justicia.

 explora el mandato bíblico para el matrimonio, “Someteos unos a otros en el temor de Dios” (Efesios 5:21). Se necesita en nuestros días cuando, en muchos casos, la sumisión en el matrimonio se ha vuelto opresiva o irrelevante.
 
Pero honrar a nuestro cónyuge es honrar al Dios del matrimonio y al pacto del matrimonio. Cumplir con los roles que Dios nos ha asignado es una cuestión de fidelidad a Dios. Dos principios subyacen en la sumisión mutua: Cristo y su Iglesia, y el pacto matrimonial. El amor de Cristo por su Iglesia y el seguimiento gozoso de la Iglesia a Cristo son los cimientos de la sumisión bíblica. La sumisión honra a Cristo cuando la vemos como una parte vital del compromiso del pacto.

Código: authfgs,Título: Autoridad ,Autor: Autor Desconhecido,"Descrição: Este número del Portavoz de la Gracia, presenta el tema de la Autoridad. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones anuncia que nuestro mundo la necesita desesperadamente. Stephen Charnock examina las Escrituras para mostrar la absoluta autoridad de Dios y Jeff Pollard declara que la autoridad de Dios es revelada en la infalible Palabra inspirada por el Espíritu. En su segundo artículo, el Dr. Lloyd-Jones aborda el tema de la autoridad de Cristo manifestada en su glorioso señorío. Benjamin Warfield describe cómo Jesús designó a sus apóstoles, quienes vivieron y ministraron con Él, para escribir los Evangelios y los demás escritos del Nuevo Testamento. El Señor quería que su Evangelio, llamando a la salvación, se extendiera por todo el mundo. Jean-Marc Berthoud nos enseña acerca de la importancia de la autoridad de Cristo en las iglesias locales. Ahora, ¿tienen los pastores, los ancianos y los ministros, autoridad real en las iglesias de Cristo? Arthur W. Pink afirma y explica, claramente, la necesidad de tal autoridad. De acuerdo con esto, los ancianos tienen la responsabilidad de predicar la Palabra autoritativa de Dios, al pueblo comprado con la sangre de Cristo, poniendo siempre ante ellos, la belleza y la gloria de su crucifixión y resurrección. Los padres también tienen autoridad, y Richard Baxter les muestra cómo usarla para la gloria de Dios y el bien de sus familias. ¿Y el gobierno civil? James Renihan nos muestra, a partir de las Escrituras y la Confesión de Fe de 1689, que los magistrados son siervos autorizados de Dios. Finalmente, C. H. Spurgeon nos bendice con ¡una conmovedora declaración de la autoridad de Cristo para salvar a los pecadores! Nuestras familias, iglesias y magistrados necesitan, desesperadamente, la autoridad de Dios para ordenar nuestro desordenado mundo. ¡Que podamos someternos a la autoridad de Dios en todas sus manifestaciones!

La Escritura inspirada por Dios
. Arthur W. Pink introduce este tema vital con pensamientos sobre la Roca inexpugnable de la Escritura y su inspiración divina. A continuación, Louis Gaussen nos ayuda a comprender qué significa, realmente, “inspiración”. En una época en que se considera que poetas y músicos ofrecen interpretaciones “inspiradas”, necesitamos una comprensión clara de esta misteriosa obra de Dios. ¿Qué es entonces, la inspiración 
verbal
? David Martyn Lloyd-Jones explica esta importante doctrina que muchos cristianos profesantes han abandonado. Seguidamente, Thomas Boston ofrece una descripción concisa del contenido del canon de las Escrituras y nos explica qué relación guardan con él, los Apócrifos. Charles Hodge profundiza en la infalibilidad y autoridad de las Palabras de Dios, mientras que Benjamin B. Warfield revela que Jesús creía y enseñaba que las Escrituras eran inspiradas por Dios y autoritativas. Y luego, una pregunta: ¿Quién tiene la autoridad última —una organización religiosa o la Escritura—? Wilhelmus à Brakel responde a esta pregunta, a la vez que enumera las características divinas que demuestran la autoridad de la Biblia. Octavius Winslow está de acuerdo en que la Creación revela la existencia de Dios, pero sólo la Biblia dice a los pecadores culpables cómo Dios salva mediante la persona y la obra de Jesucristo. En un segundo artículo, Thomas Boston reconoce que la Escritura no siempre es fácil de entender, pero todo lo que los pecadores necesitan saber para la salvación de sus almas eternas 
es
 claro. Aunque la Biblia da abundante evidencia de su origen divino, ¿por qué alguien cree que es, realmente, la Palabra de Dios? John Murray responde: “El testimonio del Espíritu Santo en el corazón humano”.

Iglesia y Estado
. No responderá a todas tus preguntas; no es su intención. De hecho, es posible que después de leerlo te surjan más preguntas. Nuestro propósito es provocarte a pensar, seria y bíblicamente, sobre este tema de nuestra actualidad. Escucharás a luteranos, presbiterianos y bautistas particulares (Reformados) —todos ellos luchando por responder a las preguntas sobre la Iglesia y el Estado, a partir de la Palabra de Dios, a menudo, llegando a conclusiones diferentes—. Comenzamos con el Capítulo 24 de la Segunda Confesión Bautista de Fe de Londres de 1677/89: “De las autoridades civiles”. Jean-Marc Berthoud explica dos tipos de poder: La autoridad civil y la Iglesia. Juan Calvino declara que Dios ha ordenado autoridades civiles para el bien de la humanidad. El querido amigo de Calvino, Pierre Viret, analiza las tres principales formas de gobierno: Monarquía, aristocracia y democracia —¿cuál es la mejor?—. A continuación, R. C. Sproul explica que la esencia del gobierno civil es la fuerza. ¿Es absoluta la autoridad del gobierno? H. Rondel Rumburg sostiene que se trata de un poder delegado, no absoluto. También analiza la Teoría del Contrato Social. Christopher Goodman, contemporáneo de Calvino y Knox, examina la verdadera obediencia ante la opresión civil o religiosa. La importante doctrina de los magistrados menores ha sido olvidada tanto por los creyentes modernos como por los incrédulos; pero Matthew Trewhella nos enseña su importancia bíblica. Edificando sobre la base de esa doctrina que los reformadores y puritanos sostenían, tenemos ejemplos extraordinarios de ella en La Confesión de Magdeburgo, John Knox e Isaac Backus —¡luteranos, un reformador presbiteriano y un bautista!—. Sus artículos muestran, claramente, la importancia bíblica y ordenada por Dios de esa doctrina. Finalmente, Samuel Davies nos habla del Rey más grande —Jesucristo— y nos lleva de la mano para mostrarnos las glorias del Reino de Jesús. Jesús gobierna sobre todos los reyes y reinos de los hombres.

Como hijo de Dios, la muerte no me causa temor ni preocupación, porque para mí la muerte es solamente la puerta que conduce a la casa de mi Padre celestial; ¿y quién teme o se preocupa por ir a casa? Puedo decir como el salmista: «Aunque ande en valle de sombra de muerte, no temeré mal alguno, porque tú estarás conmigo; tu vara y tu cayado me infundirán aliento» (Sal 23:4). Puedo decir con el apóstol Pablo en Filipenses 1:21: «Porque para mí el vivir es Cristo, y el morir es ganancia». De nuevo, en Apocalipsis, oigo estas palabras: «Bienaventurados… los muertos que mueren en el Señor» (Ap 14:13), y luego: «Bienaventurado y santo el que tiene parte en la primera resurrección; la segunda muerte no tiene potestad sobre estos» (Ap 20:6). También leí estas palabras en Números 23:10: «Muera yo la muerte de los rectos, y mi postrimería sea como la suya». ¿Por qué? porque la muerte de los justos es una muerte llena de bondad, gloria y misericordia, ya que nos conduce a la presencia del Señor Dios de gloria. También encuentro en Filipenses 3:20 que mi ciudadanía está en los cielos, desde donde espero a mi Salvador, el Señor Jesucristo, el cual transformará este cuerpo de mi humillación, para que sea semejante al cuerpo de Su gloria. El apóstol Juan también me dice en su carta: «Amados, ahora somos hijos de Dios, y aún no se ha manifestado lo que hemos de ser; pero sabemos que cuando él se manifieste, seremos semejantes a él, porque le veremos tal como él es. Y todo aquel que tiene esta esperanza en él, se purifica a sí mismo, así como él es puro»  (1Jn 3:2-3).",Preço: 0.43,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/mhoms/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mhoms&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mhoms&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Y usa cantidades falsas, porque declarará que los grandes pecados son muy pequeños, y en cuanto a los que confiesa como pequeños pecados, después los convierte en nada en absoluto: meros pecadillos, casi dignos de perdón en sí mismos. Muchas almas, no dudo, han sido atrapadas en esta artimaña, y siendo atrapadas por ella, han sido destruidas. Se han aventurado al pecado en donde pensaban que la corriente era poco profunda, y, fatalmente engañados por su profundidad, han sido arrastrados por la fuerza de la corriente a esa catarata que es la ruina de tan vasta multitud de almas de los hombres.

Nuestra unión con nuestro amado Redentor, explica John Gill, encuentra su origen en el amor eterno que Dios, el Padre, tiene por su pueblo en Cristo. ¿Qué hace la diferencia entre un cristiano y un pecador perdido?

Retomando un tema similar, pero enfocándose en la fe y la justificación en su relación con la unión, Jonathan Edwards sondea las profundidades de este importante tema. En un segundo artículo, A. W.

Código: foosf,Título: Fuir Sodome,Autor: Jonathan Edwards,"Descrição: Dans ce sermon, Jonathan Edwards donne un certain nombre de raisons pour lesquelles la fuite de Lot hors de Sodome est une image de notre fuite vers Christ, hors de notre état de péché et de misère. Il observe que ceux qui fuient ne doivent pas regarder en arrière. Sodome est une ville remplie de souillures et d’abominations qui ne mérite pas un seul regard en arrière. C’est une ville destinée à une destruction rapide et soudaine—une destruction qui sera infiniment épouvantable, universelle et éternelle. Edwards appelle solennellement ceux qui se trouvent dans leur « condition naturelle » à fuir, faisant remarquer que ce monde est divisé en deux cités : la sainte et bien-aimée Sion, et la souillée et maudite cité de Sodome. Il souligne la gravité de son avertissement par cette vérité effrayante : Celui qui est hors de Christ demeure en réalité en Sodome.",Preço: 0.69,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/foosf/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=foosf&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=foosf&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: NÃO
Código: gjudf,Título: Le jugement dernier,Autor: Charles Spurgeon,"Descrição: Le Jugement Dernier est une doctrine fondamentale du Christianisme, et une des plus solennelles. Dans ce livret, Charles Spurgeon examine à la lumière des Écritures plusieurs de ses aspects. Pour introduire le sujet, il nous montre que le Jugement Dernier suit directement la résurrection des morts, afin qu’ils soient jugés dans leurs corps. Il continue en indiquant premièrement que personne n’échappera à cet arrêté, car toute personne ayant vécu sur cette terre sera jugée. Deuxièmement, il montre que le juge sera Jésus-Christ, et aucun autre. Troisièmement, que ce jugement sera basé sur les actions faites dans ce corps. Pour finir, il en décrit le dénouement : « le Seigneur accordera à son peuple une généreuse récompense pour tout ce qu’il a accompli, et le châtiment éternel pour l’impie selon ses mauvaises œuvres  ». Spurgeon nous fait remarquer que le juste ne mérite aucune récompense mais que « Dieu lui donne premièrement la grâce d’accomplir toute œuvre bonne ; ses œuvres bonnes sont ensuite acceptées comme preuve d’un cœur renouvelé ; alors enfin Dieu lui donne une récompense pour ce qu’il a accompli ». Il résume tout cela ainsi : « …l’enfer, c’est le péché ; le ciel, la sainteté. » Il termine par un appel passionné : « Oh que nous recevions la grâce, pour chacun d’entre nous, de fuir vers Christ. Il est notre seul refuge ».",Preço: 0.61,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/gjudf/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=gjudf&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=gjudf&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: NÃO
Código: ropef,Título: Repentez-vous ou périssez,Autor: Arthur W. Pink,"Descrição: « Si vous ne vous repentez, vous périrez tous de même » (Luc 13.3). Malheureusement, cette vérité biblique est rarement entendue dans nos églises modernes. Mais, comme A.W. Pink le fait remarquer, « la repentance est absolument nécessaire si le pécheur veut être réconcilié avec Dieu. » Il continue en décrivant la repentance comme : « une sainte haine et une sainte horreur du péché, une profonde douleur de l'avoir commis ; elle consiste à reconnaître notre péché devant Dieu et à y renoncer totalement du fond du cœur ». Pink conclut ce court traité par une déclaration effrayante et une question : « Détournez-vous de votre voie de volonté personnelle et d'égocentrisme ; tournez-vous vers Dieu avec un cœur brisé, cherchant sa miséricorde en Christ ; tournez-vous avec un cœur pleinement décidé à LUI plaire et à LE servir ; ou bien vous serez tourmenté jour et nuit, aux siècles des siècles, dans l'étang de feu ».

Código: rotwf,Título: Le maître souverain des flots,Autor: J. C. Ryle,"Descrição: Ce livret commence avec l’histoire de Jésus et ses disciples traversant la mer de Galilée où Jésus fait taire le vent et les flots d’une tempête meurtrière (Marc 4.37-40). Selon J.C. Ryle, cette histoire regorge d’instructions pour chacun d’entre nous. Il explique en cinq chapitres ce que nous devons apprendre : 1) Suivre Christ ne nous évitera pas les douleurs terrestres, 2) Le Seigneur Jésus-Christ est pleinement Homme et pleinement Dieu, 3) Il peut y avoir beaucoup de faiblesse chez un chrétien authentique, 4) Christ est Tout-puissant, et 5) Christ est plein de tendresse envers son peuple. Ryle termine en décrivant l’objectif fixé en écrivant ce livret : « Je désire que les croyants connaissent mieux Jésus afin qu’ils deviennent plus joyeux, plus saints et mieux préparés pour l’héritage des saints dans la lumière ».",Preço: 0.00,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/rotwf/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=rotwf&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=rotwf&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: NÃO
Código: wltwf,Título: Lettre de Whitefield à Wesley,Autor: George Whitefield,"Descrição: Georges Whitefield écrivit cette lettre à John Wesley en 1740, répondant à un sermon de Wesley intitulé “Free Grace”. Whitefield croyait ce sujet vital pour un christianisme solide, et il se hâta d’écrire à son ami depuis la colonie américaine de Géorgie de l'autre côté de l'océan.Extrait de la préface :D’emblée, [ma lettre] offensera nombre de mes amis, zélés défenseurs de la « rédemption universelle ». En revanche, bien des défenseurs de la position adverse s’en réjouiront. Les tièdes des deux camps, captifs de leurs raisonnements charnels, diront que nous n’aurions jamais dû aborder cette question. Toutefois, les raisons que je donne au début de ma lettre me semblent suffisantes pour justifier mon choix. Mon désir est que les tenants de l’élection fuient tout triomphalisme, et se gardent bien de former un parti, chose dont j’ai horreur. D’autre part, que ceux qui ont un préjugé contre cette doctrine ne s’alarment pas et ne soient pas offensés outre mesure : Dieu connaît toutes ses voies depuis le commencement du monde.",Preço: 1.10,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/wltwf/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=wltwf&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=wltwf&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: NÃO

Código: mwfyf,Título: La volonté de l'Homme : elle existe mais elle est liée,Autor: Walter J. Chantry,"Descrição: Dans ce livret, Walter Chantry nous donne le point de vue biblique sur la volonté humaine. Il observe tout d’abord qu’une « juste compréhension de la teneur de l’Évangile et de l’utilisation de moyens qui honorent Dieu dans l’évangélisation est essentielle pour comprendre ce sujet ». Utilisant Matthieu 12.33-37 d’une manière accessible à tous, W. Chantry expose le sujet en quatre chapitres : 1) la volonté de l’homme possède une certaine liberté, 2) la volonté de l’homme n’est pas souveraine, 3) la volonté de l’homme est esclave du péché, et 4) l’espérance de l’homme ne réside pas dans sa volonté. Il termine en indiquant la seule véritable espérance de l’homme. « Certes, l'Évangile s’adresse à la volonté de l’homme, mais elle est prisonnière du linceul et des bandelettes d'un cœur mauvais. Pourtant, alors que nous parlons, et que le Seigneur lui-même confirme sa Parole, sa puissance divine communique la vie aux pécheurs. Ceux en qui Dieu agit à salut sont rendus vivants quand il déploie sa puissance » (Psaume 110:3).",Preço: 0.43,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/mwfyf/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mwfyf&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=mwfyf&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: SIM

Ainsi parle l'Éternel : Que le sage ne se glorifie pas de sa sagesse, que le fort ne se glorifie pas de sa force, que le riche ne se glorifie pas de sa richesse. Mais que celui qui veut se glorifier se glorifie d'avoir de l'intelligence et de me connaître, de savoir que je suis l'Éternel (Jérémie 9.23,24). Le besoin premier de toute créature humaine est de connaître Dieu de manière spirituelle et salvatrice.
 
Le point de départ de toute vraie connaissance de Dieu doit être une claire compréhension de ses perfections telles que l'Écriture Sainte les révèle. Comment pourrions-nous faire confiance à un Dieu inconnu, le servir et l'adorer ? Ce livre est l'expression d'un effort pour exposer quelques-unes des principales perfections qui sont en Dieu. Pour tirer un réel profit des pages ci-dessous, que le lecteur supplie Dieu de tout son cœur, en termes précis, de bénir sa lecture et d'appliquer ces vérités à sa conscience et à son coeur pour que sa vie en soit transformée.
 
Il ne suffit pas de posséder un savoir théorique sur Dieu. Dieu ne se fait connaître à notre âme que dans la mesure où nous nous abandonnons à lui en nous soumettant à son autorité, en cherchant à aligner chaque détail de notre existence sur ses saints préceptes et ses saints commandements. Connaissons, cherchons à connaître l'Éternel [en marchant dans le chemin de l'obéissance] (Osée 6.3). Si quelqu'un veut faire sa volonté, il connaîtra... (Jean 7.17). Ceux du peuple qui connaîtront leur Dieu agiront avec fermeté (Daniel 11.32).",Preço: 5.04,Link do livro: https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/aogof/,Link do PDF: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=aogof&format=pdf,Link do EPUB: https://www.chapellibrary.org/api/books/download?code=aogof&format=epub,Tem versão imprimível: NÃO
