        "descricao": "With love for Christ and a burning desire to help men understand their God-ordained roles as husbands, we offer this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster, \nA Husband’s Love. \nMatthew Henry sets the stage for the rest of the articles with his comments on Genesis 2—man’s responsibility to love his wife began in the Garden of Eden. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones then describes a Christlike love for us, since the Lord Jesus is the model from which husbands must learn how to love. What are the responsibilities of such a love? Ezekiel Hopkins gives us an overview. John Angell James then gives us a detailed survey of how Christ loved His church. In a second article, Lloyd-Jones carefully and biblically explains how men may love their wives as they love themselves. In a profound and deeply challenging article, Benjamin Palmer gives us insight into the force of love, the abuse of authority, and the affect these have on a woman’s heart. This article may be a difficult read for some, but it is worth repeated and prayerful reading. Men know well how to love themselves, and John Angell James appeals to them to apply the same to their wives. And who better than Charles Spurgeon can take the golden example of Christ loving His church and bringing it home to a husband’s heart? He does so with great power, clarity, and verve. Finally, with a heart full of Puritan fire, George Swinnock offers up a husband’s prayer for the grace to love as Christ and for the spiritual wellbeing of his dear wife. These articles will richly repay those who prayerfully apply them.",

Second, Adoniram Judson set an example of total commitment to inspire missionaries in enduring the inevitable strains peculiar to their calling. Third, there is the reality of the unfinished task of reaching the yet unreached people groups of the world.

He that is most loaded seems the most likely to pass in and begin the heavenward journey; but what ails the other men? This is what I want to find out. Poor fellows! they have come a long way already to get where they are; and the King’s highway, which they seek, is right before them: why do they not take to the Pilgrim Road at once?…Only the Lord Himself can …lead them to take the great decisive step. Yet the Lord works by means; and I have prepared this little book in the earnest hope that He may work by it to the blessed end of leading seekers to an immediate, simple trust in the Lord Jesus.”          —\nfrom the Preface, Charles Spurgeon",

Both Erasmus and Luther rejected many of the erroneous practices of the Roman Catholic church. But Luther went further to challenge the Roman teaching of salvation by works. Erasmus pleased the Pope by writing to uphold the Roman dogma of “free will,” that man could of himself decide to choose for his salvation. Luther saw correctly that the Biblical doctrines of the depravity of man and salvation by faith alone stand together. He declared Erasmus to be an enemy of the faith, and wrote \nThe Bondage of the Will\n to establish this doctrine at the core of evangelicalism. The \nModern English Series\n are modernized abridgments of great Christian classics, for a blessing to many worldwide.",

For both the reader new to Calvinistic thought and the scholar, this serves as a most useful explanation of a difficult subject—a subject that must be clarified amidst great confusion in our day. Calvin explains the doctrines, expounds their impact on grace and works, and refutes major objections. Man is humbled; God is exalted!",

In general Bible knowledge, Scofield makes many mistakes, and in his eschatology he goes far astray from anything the Church has ever believed.”\n \nThis booklet holds four erroneous doctrinal areas of the Scofield Bible up to biblical light to reveal its errors and set the reader on the right path of orthodox Christianity: 1) artificial typology, 2) doctrine of dispensations and covenants, 3) eschatology, and 4) doctrine of the church.",

Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609) was a Dutch theologian and prominent pastor in Amsterdam. He was eloquent and well educated, his sermons attracting large audiences not only for their content but for their controversy. According to Arminius, the orthodox faith of the Reformation was wrong. He taught that God chooses for salvation only those whom He has foreseen will believe. By 1592 Arminius had been formally accused of heresy. In 1610, his zealous followers presented five objections to the standard confessions of faith from the Reformation; the theology behind these objections came to be called \nArminianism. \n \nThe whole church was caught up with theological debate, and a council was called to resolve the controversy. The Synod of Dort concluded with a rejection of Arminianism, and in \nThe Canons of Dort \nset forth the orthodox Reformed doctrine on each point; today these are sometimes referred to as \nthe doctrines of grace\n. As termed in the original preface, it is a “judgment, in which both the true view agreeing with God’s Word concerning the aforesaid five points of doctrine is explained, and the false view disagreeing with God’s Word is rejected.”",

Soon thereafter, Benjamin Keach (1640-1704) tailored the Westminster Shorter Catechism to the London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 (which is based on the Westminster except in its chapters on church government, the covenants, and baptism). Later, Charles Spurgeon (1834-1892) updated Keach’s catechism for his own congregation. \r\n \nMore recently, Erroll Hulse knew that a more simplified Baptist catechism was needed so that parents could train their young children at home.

Marshall proclaims the truth that Christ \"loved us in our most loathsome sinful pollution, so as to die for us, and much more will He love us in it, so as to receive us when we come to Him for the purchased salvation.\" To those who have already received Christ and been received by Him, he gives a call to holiness by continual faith in the grace and Spirit of Christ, not trusting in their own works, but walking by faith in Him.",

While we are in the world, we must not be of the world—always aware of God’s command, “Be not conformed to this world” (Rom. 12:2). Not only that, but we should consider ourselves travelers in a foreign land, for this world was never meant to be our home. On the other hand, Herendeen cautions us not to stand aloof from all relationships with unconverted people; our Lord certainly did not. In the end he challenges us, “Persevere in your separation from the world…you will never regret having lived too holy and too separated a life.”",

First, recognize that good works flow from faith and not the other way around. Second, be careful to insure that the works one does are actually good—here Bunyan describes the duties of Christians in the family and other relationships. Third, do not be satisfied with simply a commendable beginning, but continue faithfully in a life of good works. Lastly, Bunyan urges Christians to understand and believe in the doctrine of justification by grace—as a powerful motivation for doing good works.",

They are lopsided in that they believe some scriptures, but not all scriptures because they are “unable to harmonize the two different parts of God’s truth.” Indeed, tying themselves down to a theological system, they “place a higher value on \nconsistency\n than they do fidelity.” He expands on this under four headings: using reason rather than faith, holding to a theology that is narrower than scripture, viewing the various parts of God’s word in a disproportionate way, and “proving” truth by creed and logic. In summary, Pink gives a timely admonishment to all believers, counseling them to insure that they fit their theology to Scripture rather than Scripture to their theology.",

This is an important discussion for both men and women. While this controversial subject often falls into the realm of subjective experience and speculation, the author begins with a study of Holy Scripture. An examination of fashion authorities and historians of modern culture also reveals that the fashion industry, which believes that sexual attraction equals beauty, has been hard at work convincing society to undress in public. Because of its unbiblical worldview, the fashion industry persistently justifies the exposure and the sensualizing of the human body, a trend that many undiscerning Christians have unfortunately adopted. \nChristian Modesty\n is an urgent call to the churches of Jesus Christ to study this matter carefully and to practice a modesty that brings glory to our Holy Redeemer and gives a powerful testimony of purity within our decadent society.",

We see God’s character displayed in the beginnings of the world and of man. But sin appears, and its terrible consequences bring the just judgments of God. God then shows His love and mercy in setting apart one family to become His very own people. God redeems them from slavery, gives them His Law, and declares to them His holiness—and they willingly enter into a national covenant with Him. By God’s grace, they become a great nation reflecting the Kingdom of God: His people, in His place, under His rule. By His prescribed sacrifices, sinners can live with the holy God in their midst. Yet from this blessed place, the united kingdom divides, and Israel and then Judah fall prey to pride, idolatry, formalism, and spiritual adultery. God sends His prophets to their kings, repeatedly calling the nation to repentance and faith. But the people will not hear, and God dramatically uses new empires to judge His very own. Even then, however, there is hope in God’s gracious promises: a Redeemer will come to deliver once and for all His people from their sins.\n \n“The knowledge of God…appears throughout as an internal expansion, an organic unfolding from within…The gospel of Paradise is such a germ in which the gospel of Paul is potentially present: and the gospel of Abraham, of Moses, of David, of Isaiah and Jeremiah, are all expansions of this original message of salvation, each pointing forward to the next stage of growth and bringing the gospel idea one step nearer to its full realization.”—\nGeerhardus Vos (1862-1949)",

He can now truly say that he loves God’s law, which has been written on his heart. He soon discovers, however, that this sets off continuing conflict against indwelling sin. In the midst of these battles, the believer feels wretched about his sin, seeks the Lord for deliverance, and gives thanks for each victory. The fight against the flesh never ceases in this life, but according to McCheyne, there is a sure promise that in the end sin shall be rooted out altogether.",

Lloyd-Jones gives us at least one reason by asking, \"When did you last hear any reference from a Christian pulpit to the subject of discipline? How often have you heard sermons or addresses on the subject? The word has almost gone right out of existence and what it stands for and represents has fallen into disuse.\"\n \nIn light of this, this Free Grace Broadcaster takes up Church Discipline. R. Albert Mohler, Jr., introduces this crucial subject by explaining the historical and cultural reasons that church discipline has vanished from American churches. Hezekiah Harvey then biblically defines church discipline. James Bannerman reveals from Scripture that discipline did not originate with human tradition: it was a positive institution by Jesus Christ the Head of the Church. John Gill then instructs us in the biblical ways that a church admits people to or excludes them from its membership. In a second article, Mohler demonstrates that Christ-instituted discipline preserves the visible purity of those who profess the name of the risen Christ. Daniel Wray explains the necessity of discipline, followed by a third article from Mohler that describes the three vital areas that require discipline. What are the modes of church discipline? What is Christ's church authorized to do in this matter? Daniel Wray answers these questions for us. Excommunication is a difficult subject, and Jonathan Edwards details the nature of this severe discipline. No one can practice this in church life without encountering objections. Wray gives answers to a few of the more common ones. Finally, Charles Spurgeon exhorts us personally and as congregations of Christ Jesus to keep the Lord's chruch pure.",

They are read at church services, funerals, and many other occasions. They are often called “the comfortable words.” But what do they mean? What does it mean to “come” to Jesus? Who is He, and why should we “come” to Him? In this attractive presentation of the Christian faith, Tom Wells answers these questions. In an engaging style he explains who Jesus Christ is and what it means to “come” to Him. He writes honestly about the barriers which stand in the way of faith, and about the cost involved in being a disciple. But he also shows clearly that there is nothing more important we can ever do than “come” to Christ.",

He can receive nothing from another nor be limited by the power of another. Finally, as the Supreme Sovereign of the universe, God exercises His sovereignty according to His own imperial and righteous pleasure. He has mercy on whom He will, and whom He will He hardens. Pink leaves us with this sobering comment: “To the Christian, He is a tender Father; to the rebellious sinner He will yet be a consuming fire.”",

He shows, in the first place, that there is nothing in Zaccheus that makes him fit for salvation. On the contrary, as a publican, he was “in all probability a notorious sinner.” Whitefield further points out that Jesus calls him by name. Zaccheus had come to see Jesus out of curiosity, but according to His sovereign, electing grace, Jesus, who had known this man from eternity, now effectually calls him in time. Concluding his sermon, Whitefield implores his listeners, “Make haste, O ye publicans and sinners, and give the dear Lord Jesus your hearts, your whole hearts.” He ends with a plaintive prayer, “O that you may know the things that belong to your everlasting peace, before they are eternally hid from your eyes.”",

He likens this to Romans 12:1, “Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.” Taking up one’s cross is essentially embracing an instrument of death. According to Pink, the cross stands for several hallmarks of Christ’s life—the world’s hatred, voluntary surrender to the will of God, and sacrificial suffering and death. His conclusion is this: legally, the cross of Christ stands alone as it put away the guilt of our sins, but as deliverance from the power of sin in our lives, the cross is to be shared by all believers.",

The purpose of this booklet is not to question the sincerity of some Christians or to malign them, but to unite Christians in biblical truth. The gospel alone is the power of God unto salvation and the true basis of Christian unity.\n \nSince 1980, \nDr. James E.

Pink begins this tract by defining God’s decrees, declaring that they consist of “His purpose or determination with respect to future things.” Indeed, they “relate to all future things without exception: whatever is done in time was foreordained before time began.” Pink goes on to give four major properties of God’s decrees. First, they are eternal. That is, they were not done in time, but in eternity. Second, the decrees of God are wise. This wisdom is “shown in the selection of the best possible ends and of the fittest means of accomplishing them.” Third, they are free. His determinations were influenced by no external cause. And fourth, they are absolute and unconditional. Their execution is not dependent on any condition which may or may not be performed. Pink concludes with encouraging words—“how thankful we should be that everything is determined by infinite wisdom and goodness.”",

Finally, he speaks of those Christians who “cannot see these truths” with true Christian charity, “They have received Christ as their Saviour, and are as dear to the heart of the God of grace as the soundest Calvinist.”",

He elaborates on divine healing by first considering unscriptural teaching on the subject and then turning to what he calls “the positive side” of this issue. Under the latter, Pink looks at the general subject of human health and the duties and privileges of Christians in illness. Finally, he considers the implications of three well-known passages of Scripture—2 Chronicles 7:14, Matthew 9:29, and James 5:14-16.",

There is abroad today a widespread suspicion that a robust faith in the absolute sovereignty of God is bound to undermine any adequate sense of human responsibility. The Bible presents both of these as true: 1) God’s sovereignty in electing some people to be saved, and 2) all peoples’ responsibility to call upon the Lord to be saved. Many err when they try to reconcile these two truths. They either affirm sovereignty and avoid calling men to turn to God; or they focus on encouraging men to “invite Christ into their hearts” and teach that God does not rule sovereignly over all of life. In this booklet, both truths are upheld as vital. One must not be neglected in order to be comfortable with the other. The author shows us how both truths coexist in the infinitely wise economy of God.\n \nJ. I.

Some of our readers will probably be very disappointed when they see the title, deeming the subject quite unattractive…Medicine is proverbially unpleasant, but there are times when all of us find it necessary and beneficial…Surely that which most glorifies God is to declare \nall \nHis counsel, to insist on that which puts man in his proper place before Him, and to emphasize those portions and aspects of the truth which our generation is most in need of. As we shall endeavour to show, our theme is one of immense doctrinal importance and of great practical value, since it is a subject which occupies so prominent a place in God’s Word. It is our deep conviction that the vital question most requiring to be raised today is this: Is man a totally and thoroughly depraved creature by nature?...According as is our answer to \nthat\n question, so will be our views on many others…Any attempt to modify or abate, repudiate or tone down the teaching of Scripture thereon is fatal.”—\nA.W.

He reveals his motivation for writing up front, declaring that there was a time when justification was one of the best known doctrines of the Christian faith, but among many in his time there was almost total ignorance of this truth. He opens up the doctrine under nine headings: justification’s meaning, its problem, its basis, its nature, its source, its objects, its instrument, its evidence, and its results. In conclusion, Pink points out that while the Christian’s justification is complete the moment he truly believes in Christ, the following distinctions can be noted: justification was decreed from all eternity, was effective when Christ rose from the dead, is actuated when the Christian believes, felt when the Spirit bestows assurance, manifested on the path of obedience, and pronounced by God publicly at the Day of Judgment.",

He then describes the nature of true repentance, its necessity, motives, and effects. He closes with strong exhortations to repent from every sin, how to remove impediments, and the means for true repentance.

Turning to the parents, Adams admonishes them to “Rule over your children in such a way that they love and honor you for it.” Finally, after describing their many practical duties, he urges parents to be faithful in two foundational ways—praying always for their children and setting a good example in the way they live.",

In Pastor Al Martin’s proven style, he tells the reader at the start, “It is the Word of God that marks out the path of what a pastor’s wife ought to be, how she should fulfill her God-given roles and responsibilities.” These insights are grounded in Scripture and will indeed surprise and encourage the pastor’s wife in her unique walk—with her husband and with her God.",

Therefore, the Christian is not at liberty to simply choose one that suits his fancy, and the church cannot be indifferent in the selection of a translation for public use.

It was at the center of the later Marrow Controversy.\n \nHere Fisher gives a dialogue between a gospel minister and struggling souls to correct misconceptions regarding the Law, grace, and works. Fisher urges, \"Come to Christ by believing that He will accept of you, justify, and save you freely by His grace, according to His gracious promise. This is neither pride nor presumption: for Christ having tendered and offered it to you freely, believe it, it is true humility of heart to take what Christ offers you.\"",

He addresses the latter in words spoken by the angel just prior to Sodom’s devastation, “Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed” (Gen. 19:17). From this passage he admonishes unbelievers:\n \n \nRealize your danger (you are under the wrath of God, just like Sodom).\n \nForsake all (you must give up everything to follow Christ).\n \nRun for your life (you must flee this wicked world).\n \n \nBeeke sums it up this way, “Oh, I beseech you, run for your life; run straight to Christ. Don’t run to ceremonies, feelings, ministers, works, orthodoxies—but run straight to Christ.”",

Because the sinner is in alarming danger; the punishment that awaits him is awful, hopeless, unendurable, and endless. In a word, Herendeen wrote to give sinners a solemn warning. He does this by expounding on the nature of hell, the sinner’s great folly, and the ferocity of God’s wrath. He concludes by explaining who goes to hell and why, and showing the only way of escape—“Flee to the blessed Saviour.”",

Edward Pearse holds forth the staggering truth of God’s faithfulness being based upon His unchangeableness. Charles Bridges takes the reader to the Psalms to see that the LORD is faithful even in the affliction of His children. John Flavel assures the saints that God’s faithfulness is the believer’s security and city of refuge in a world of disappointments. Richard Sibbes follows by drawing on the thought that God is faithful in His nature, faithful in His Word, and faithful in His works. Thomas Manton shows forth God’s consistent faithfulness being put on display in every generation. Charles Simeon highlights God’s faithfulness in His inability to lie.

Because of this ignorance, it is easy for unlearned teachers to spread erroneous doctrine. A common error is the following: in opposition to the clear teaching of Scripture that God sovereignly chose certain people for salvation, these teachers argue that God, in His “foreknowledge,” looked into the future and saw that certain people would believe—and so predestined them to salvation. This turns Scripture on its head, making man the final arbiter of his salvation rather than God. In repudiating this error, Pink explains the true meaning of foreknowledge as taught in Scripture, showing that it is “never used in connection with events or actions, but always refers to persons.” It is individual people that God is said to foreknow, not the actions of those people.",

We have many motives and reasons provided to lead us to this glorious work. Family worship includes reading God's Word and praying together. The responsibility of family worship rests on the father, though mothers also have a responsiblity if the man is absent. John G. Paton provides a touching illustration of family worship from his Scottish boyhood home and from his missionary endeavors in the South Sea Islands.

        "descricao": "Matthew Henry said, “Masters of families, who preside in the other affairs of the house, must go before their households in the things of God. They must be as prophets, priests, and kings in their own families; and as such they must keep up family-doctrine, family-worship, and family-discipline.” The master of a family in Henry’s time was the male head of a household—usually a husband or father. The Reformers and Puritans often spoke of fathers this way. The biblical vision of fatherhood that arises from the pages of Scripture is beautiful, majestic, and holy. It is also foreign to the day in which we live.\n \nAs Henry points out, fathers “must go before their households in the things of God.” The biblical picture of a father is of one who leads his family according to the Word of God. He is a representative of God and Christ. This means that he must be a man of prayer, of the Word, and of humble holiness. By faith in Christ, trusting in His grace, empowered by His Spirit, and informed by the Word, a father must keep up “family doctrine.” This means he should be able to teach his family the truths of God’s Word. He must keep up “family worship.” His home must be a place where he leads his loved ones in the worship of the thrice-holy Triune God, in prayer, in the reading of Scripture, and in song. And he must keep up “family discipline.” That is, he must govern his home under Christ, blessing the obedient and chastening the disobedient—all under the grace, mercy, and love of Jesus Christ the Lord. He must learn from Christ, walk with Christ, and model Christ’s truth in his home.\n \nDo we understand fatherhood this way? Along with many other biblical doctrines, the biblical doctrine of fatherhood has fallen on hard times. Our decaying and perverse culture needs a mighty generation of biblical fathers to rise up from the ashes of authoritarianism, abdicationism, selfism, feminism, and same-sex-ism to follow Christ, whatever the cost.\n \nWith this in mind, we offer the latest issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster, \nFatherhood. \nWilliam Gurnall briefly introduces us to this subject by describing a father’s roles as a \nprophet\n to instruct the family, a \nking\n to govern the family, and a \npriest\n to lead the family in the worship of God. Arthur W. Pink then helps us understand that fatherhood is a responsibility and a privilege, as a father instructs his children, models the Christian life for them, disciplines them, and prays for them. John Calvin explains a father’s main responsibility. Richard Baxter writes that, in order to properly lead a family for Christ, a father must understand and maintain biblical authority in his home, skill in governing, and holiness of life. We then learn from Nicholas Byfield that a father must be godly. What does this look like? Byfield tells us by giving us a list of signs by which fathers may identify Christ’s work in their hearts. To be a “prophet” in his home, a father must teach the Word of God, says Thomas Doolittle; and to be effectual in that good work, he, as a “priest,” must be a man of prayer. Every father knows that bringing up children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord is a difficult task; for this reason, William Gouge discusses the loving discipline that a father must exercise as “king” in his home. However, Thomas Watson makes abundantly clear that fathers must act prudently toward their children: otherwise, they can provoke them to wrath. Having considered all this, what practical steps can a man take to accomplish it? Richard Baxter gives clear, helpful, biblical counsel to fathers who would reform their families in the name of Jesus Christ. Finally, George Swinnock concludes this subject with an earnest, heartfelt prayer to be the father that Christ has saved him to be.\n \nIf you find these articles biblical and useful, then please join us in praying that God the Father will be pleased through the Person and work of His Son and the power of His Holy Spirit to raise up a ...",

        "descricao": "The Word of God tells us, \"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom\" (Pro 9:10). This is strange language to the ears of the world. Unfortunately, it also seems to be strange to many of God's children. No doubt there are many reasons for this; but standing at the head of the line is that sobering reality that \nnothing \ndeprives us of our joys and pleasures like fear. Edmund Burke said, \"No passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as fear.\"\n \nFear...strength withers in its presence. Happiness flees. It's a fact woven into the fabric of our daily lives. This is why we often think of fear only in that dreadful sense of anxiety when we face the presence of danger...So we usually conclude that fear is to be avoided at all costs.\n \nYet the Bible tells us the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Christians often misunderstand what the fear of God is. How are we to understand this? How can we fear God and love Him at the same time? This issue of the Broadcaster attempts to answer these questions and to bring some clarity to this most important subject. From A.W. Pink's and Charles Bridges' short and helpful articles to the lengthier discourses by A'Brakel, Gill, Bunyan, and Spurgeon, there is a clear Biblical unfolding of this glorious theme. Our prayer is that you will find much help and edification as you digest each of these blessed articles.",

If God does one of these things, He does them all. And if He does them all, then every person that He foreknows He will surely glorify. This should give believers great encouragement and hope for the future.

        "descricao": "Charles Spurgeon asks a very important question: for whom did Christ die? The straight-forward answer is given in Romans 5:6—\nfor the ungodly\n. Expanding on this truth, he first lays out the hopeless condition of the ungodly, moving from there to the truth that Christ died for sinners just like them, and on to the plain inferences that may be drawn from this. For the ungodly these inferences are twofold. First, they are already under God’s wrath and in great danger. Second, only Christ can deliver them out of this danger and only through His death. Spurgeon concludes by addressing the believers in his congregation, urging them to make the truth of Romans 5:6 the central message of their lives. Turning to the unsaved, his plea is simple: “There is life in a look at the crucified One…look to Him now and live.”",

        "descricao": "According to A. W. Pink, many in the church are ignorant of the Scriptural meaning of foreknowledge. Because of this ignorance, it is easy for unlearned teachers to spread erroneous doctrine. The most common error is the following: in opposition to the clear teaching of Scripture that God sovereignly chose certain people for salvation, these teachers argue that God, in His “foreknowledge,” looked into the future and saw that certain people would believe—and so predestined them to salvation. This turns Scripture on its head, making man the final arbiter of his salvation rather than God. In repudiating this error, Pink explains the true meaning of foreknowledge as taught in Scripture, showing that it is “never used in connection with events or actions, but always refers to persons.” It is individual people that God is said to foreknow, not the actions of those people.",

There are but two alternatives before us: we must either be forgiven, or be miserable forever.” He next addresses the question of \nhow\n we are forgiven. Speaking directly to the unsaved, he implores them, “Cast your soul, with all its sins, unreservedly on Christ; cease completely from any dependence on your own works.” After describing several characteristics of those who have been forgiven—they hate sin, they love Christ, they are humble, holy, and forgiving—Ryle ends with a solemn warning to those who know they are not forgiven, and a word of exhortation to those who are.",

Secondly, we learn that the heart is the seat of true religion and that the true Christian is the Christian in heart. Thirdly, we learn that true religion must never expect to be popular—it will not have the “praise of man, but of God.” Ryle ends by addressing three types of people—formal Christians, those under conviction of sin, and true believers—offering wise counsel to each.",

In summary, Pink shows that God’s sovereign work of salvation spans eternity and time, stretching from election in eternity past, to justification and struggle with indwelling sin in this life, and culminating in a merciful end to the struggle as we leave this earth for our eternal home in heaven—never to see or experience sin again.",

So it follows that any man who does come will know by his very coming that he has been chosen and enabled by God’s saving grace.

        "descricao": "John Owen said, “No man shall ever behold the glory of Christ by sight in heaven who does not, in some measure, behold it by faith in this world.” Furthermore, Octavius Winslow puts it this way: “If a man sees not the glory of Christ, we hesitate not to say of him that with regard to all other spiritual objects, he is totally blind—he is yet a stranger to the illuminating grace of the Holy Spirit.” What do you think of those statements? Be honest. Do you agree with them? Or do you think them an aberration, an exaggeration…maybe a form of mysticism? Owen goes on to say, “Let no one deceive himself. He that has no sight of Christ’s glory here shall never see it hereafter.” Really? Thankfully, he explains himself: “The beholding of Christ in glory is too high, glorious, and marvelous for us in our present condition. The splendor of Christ’s glory is too much for our physical eyes just as is the sun shining in all its strength. So, while we are here on earth, we can behold His glory only by faith.” So, he is not talking about dreams or visions. Rather, he says in his famous work, \nMeditations and Discourses on the Glory of Christ, in His Person, Office, and Grace: with the Differences between Faith and Sight Applied unto the Use of Them That Believe\n—or simply, \nThe Glory of Christ\n—that we can only see Christ’s glory in the Scriptures, preeminently in the gospel, through faith quickened by the Holy Spirit. When I first read Owen’s book, I confess that I was surprised, challenged, reproved, corrected, edified, and transformed. And, after prayer and contemplation, I realized that Owen’s point was simple, profound, and much neglected by modern Christianity. Friend, do you \nsee\n the glory of Christ?\n \nWe read Owen in our Chapel Library staff prayer meeting, and with hearts humbled by God’s transforming truth, souls warmed with biblical glimpses of the Sun of Righteousness, affections moved by the stunning beauty of the Savior, and lives transformed by seeing Him Who loved us from all eternity, we offer you this Free Grace Broadcaster: \nThe Glory of Christ. \nJohn Owen introduces us to this vital subject by explaining the great privilege of seeing Christ’s glory in \nthis\n world as preparation for seeing His eternal splendor and majesty in the \nnext\n. Following this, Owen briefly explains that the glory of Christ is the glory of the \nperson\n of Christ. Charles Spurgeon then helps us to glimpse that glory with a remarkable and concise panorama of Christ’s love, His incarnation, His atoning sacrifice, His resurrection, His enthronement, and His second coming! Oh, what a vision it is! Octavius Winslow then declares that there is no love like Christ’s—a revealing love, a condescending love, a self-sacrificing love, and a forgiving love. John Flavel skillfully reveals the glory of Christ in His offices as our Prophet, our Priest, and our King. Then, William Plumer gives us yet another panoramic look at Christ; but this time in His humiliation, that is, His obedient submission to His Father in His earthly life—from virgin conception to His suffering and agony on Calvary’s cross. From there, Spurgeon declares to us that Christ’s crucifixion is Christ’s glory! He presents the revelation of Christ lifted up, drawing sinners to Himself in the greatest love ever manifested in this depraved world. But Christ’s story and glory do not end there: Thomas Watson shows us that God the Father exalted His Son in His titles, His office, His ascension, His session at God’s right hand, and His judging of the world! If we really see Christ so, our hearts cannot but be ravished by His beauty; and Octavius Winslow proclaims that there is no beauty like Christ’s beauty—nothing in the universe compares! Winslow then brings this theme to a close by challenging us to \ncontemplate\n Christ’s astonishing glory.",

        "descricao": "Charles Spurgeon said of the Scriptures, “This volume is the writing of the living God: each letter was penned with an Almighty finger; each word in it dropped from the everlasting lips, each sentence was dictated by the Holy Spirit.” This was once \nthe\n bedrock doctrine of biblical Christianity. It lay at the heart of the Protestant Reformation, which many are remembering this year. That extraordinary event was not merely about the correct view of justification, the true worship of God, or the reformation of marriage and family. Underlying all this was the most important question for all people at all times to answer: “What is our final authority?” Without an authoritative revelation from God, we have no object for our faith. The inspired, infallible Word of God is our final authority for all of life. As stated in the Second London Baptist Confession of 1689, “The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience” (1.1).\n \nUnfortunately, few professing Christians believe this anymore. So, with this thought, we present the first FGB of 2017: \nGod-breathed Scripture\n. Arthur W. Pink introduces this vital subject with thoughts on the impregnable rock of Scripture and its divine inspiration. Louis Gaussen then helps us understand what “inspiration” really means. In a day when poets and musicians are considered to offer “inspired” performances, we need a clear grasp of this mysterious act of God. What then is \nverbal\n inspiration? David Martyn Lloyd-Jones explains this important doctrine, which many professing Christians have abandoned. Thomas Boston then gives a concise description of the contents of the canon of Scripture and tells us how the Apocrypha relates to it. Charles Hodge gives insight into the infallibility and authority of God’s words, while Benjamin B. Warfield reveals that Jesus believed and taught that the Scriptures were God-breathed and authoritative. And then a question: which has ultimate authority—a religious organization or Scripture? Wilhelmus à Brakel answers this, and lists divine characteristics that prove the Bible authoritative. Octavius Winslow agrees that creation reveals the existence of God, but only the Bible tells us how God saves through the person and work of Jesus Christ. In a second article, Thomas Boston acknowledges that Scripture is not always easy to understand, yet everything sinners need to know for the salvation of their eternal souls \nis\n clear. Though the Bible gives abundant evidence of its divine origin, why does anyone truly believe it is God’s Word? John Murray answers, “The witness of the Holy Spirit in the human heart.” Finally, Charles Spurgeon reaffirms that, in Scripture, God speaks; and for that very reason, we should give our earnest attention to every word of it.\n \nAs we begin this new year, our hearts’ desire is to encourage you to love, believe, obey, and commune with the Living God through His inspired Word. Study it for yourself, teach it to your children, preach it to the lost, and send it around the world!",

Referring to a popular but false view of God, he affirms that God is \nmuch more\n than one who has given man the power of choice and consequently cannot compel man to do His bidding. Pink goes on to describe the true God of Scripture, pointing out how God’s ways are infinitely higher than ours. He concludes with an exhortation to the reader: “This is the first lesson we have to learn: that God is the creator, we the creature; that He is the Potter, we the clay.” According to Pink, this is also a lesson we must continually re-learn.",

This and many other passages are why Witsius and others believed then and still believe today that an eternal agreement between the Father and Son is plainly set forth in the infallible Word of God. For instance: “This is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing” (Joh 6:39).\n \nTo encourage God’s people to think deeply about these matters, we present this issue of the FGB, \nGod’s Eternal Purpose...\nDavid Martyn Lloyd-Jones introduces this deeply profound subject. Charles Spurgeon then beautifully, movingly explains the parties, stipulations, and objects of God’s eternal counsels. What is the nature of this eternal agreement? Patrick Gillespie describes it, and Peter Bulkeley offers a brief list of the promises and agreements exchanged between the Father and the Son in eternity. The biblical reality of God’s plan is explored by R. B. C. Howell, and A. W. Pink shows the importance of Christ’s election as our Mediator. Now, is this all speculation, or is there any practical value to the contemplation of this subject? Thomas Brooks answers that question with a detailed exposition of the agreements between Father and Son, aimed at the edification and encouragement of believers. A. A. Hodge helps us to see that the only way to understand Christ’s atonement properly is through the lens of God’s eternal purpose. And then, Spurgeon, in a second article, gives us a breathtaking vision of the consummation of God’s plan—the marriage of the Lamb. Finally, Isaac Ambrose urges us to a deep love for Christ because He planned and agreed to be our Savior before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah! What a Savior!",

Octavius Winslow, a man whose writings are steeped in the love of God, introduces us to God’s glorious attribute of love. Arthur Pink then reveals the extraordinary nature of God’s infinite love for His people. Puritan Thomas Manton shows us that first God loved His eternal Son in eternity, then, He loved His people in Christ, and now He loves Christ in His people. Do we have a good grasp of how that love comes from eternity into history? Thomas Reade helps us to see this in Christ Jesus. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones shows us that God manifests His love in many ways; but the clearest, highest, and most beautiful way is in the person and work of Jesus Christ our Lord. How does a Christian live in this world of sorrow, heartaches, troubles, and misery? In a second article, Winslow tells us that we should trust God’s love for us in every providence. Samuel Eyles Pierce wants us to ponder deeply the Apostle John’s command to \nbehold \nthe wonderful love God had for us in eternity, has for us now, and will have forever. Few people can preach about God’s love with the authority, tenderness, and clarity of Charles Spurgeon. He sets before us God’s immeasurable love in His eternally loved Son for His eternally loved people. And Winslow has the final word: having given a biblical exposition of God’s mighty love in Christ, in this last article, he soberly tells what happens when God’s love turns to anger.\n \nDrink in what the Scriptures truly teach about God and His love in the words of these faithful preachers. Gaze upon the love that is so high, so wide, so deep that it transforms the human soul forever. Contemplate the mighty, eternal, full, and free love of God in Christ, and love Him back by repenting of your sins, by looking in faith to Christ, and by humbly obeying Him. He is worthy because He \nis\n love, and He loves His people in Christ.",

He first considers the minuteness of providence, noting that most people have no trouble seeing God’s providence in the great things, but few can appreciate His working in the very smallest things—even though the two cannot be separated. He points out in the second place that God’s providence is His “kind consideration in taking care of His people.” He concludes with a three-fold application: understanding God’s providence should make us bold and fearless, should give us comfort in the loss of loved ones, and should keep our reaction to the ups and downs of life in balance.",

Grace is all the more glorious in light of man’s tremendous need, without hope and without God in this world. But this need, with no merit in ourselves, is but the opening for God to pour forth His grace freely and abundantly. God’s love and justice in shedding the lifeblood of His only Son and His holiness in honoring His law are but aspects of the beauty of His grace. Bonar concludes with a clear presentation of gospel grace and how those without Christ may be joined to Him by grace through faith alone.",

Indeed, men of the world will allow God to be everywhere except on His throne. Pink goes on to point out a long line of examples from Scripture in which the sovereignty of God is put on open display. He ends with this: “Here, then, is the highest and grandest display of the absolute sovereignty of God. Verily, He has ‘mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth’ (Rom 9:18).”",

We will see that no one is saved against his will; however, God changes the “willer” so as to make the sinner willing. We will see that the subject of free will is at the very heart of Christianity and has a profound effect on our message and method of evangelism. We will see that “whosoever will may come.” We will see that the Bible teaches that salvation depends not on man’s willingness but on God’s willingness, God’s grace, and God’s power—and if God did not have power over man’s will the whole world would go to hell. We will see that God does not exclude anyone in His invitations; however, sinners do exclude themselves.”\n \nErnest C.

Shelton concludes with a description of the unbeliever’s perilous condition—he is condemned already, God’s sword is ready to come down at any moment, and God has made no promise to stay His hand. The remedy? “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.” Acts 16:31.",

Fourth, while the gospel is a “proclamation of pardon addressed to sinners without exception…it is the power of God unto salvation only to those who believe,” whose hearts are purified by faith. Fifth, he warns that all who claim to be saved, but do not live soberly and righteously in this present world, and show no fruit, prove their salvation is a delusion.",

He goes on to indicate in the first place that no one escapes this final accounting, for every person who has ever lived will be judged; secondly, that the judge is none other than Jesus Christ Himself; thirdly, that the basis of judgment consists of those things done in the body; and finally, he describes the outcome—“the Lord will grant unto His people an abundant reward for all that they have done” and unto the ungodly the eternal punishment due to their sinful deeds. Spurgeon is quick to point out that the righteous do not deserve any reward, but that “God first gave them grace to do good works, then took their good works as evidence of a renewed heart, and then gave them a reward for what they had done.” He sums it all up this way, “…sin is hell and holiness is heaven.” And ends with an impassioned plea, “Oh, that we may have grace, every one of us, to flee to Christ.

Second, trouble can be sent by God for benefits besides reproof of sin—for example, His purpose can be to make His people more like Christ, or fit them for greater usefulness in Christian service. The suffering believer should seek Divine consolation in the midst of all his trouble, confessing and forsaking every known sin. Whatever God does, it is for His glory and His people’s good.",

Explaining that the primary cause underlying all of this is found in the sovereign will of God, Philpot points out that there are also a number of secondary causes. For example, those who reject Christ do so because of blindness of heart, self-righteousness, worldliness of mind, or unbelief. In addition, he explores the motives of those who falsely profess a heavenly birth under three headings taken from John 1:13—born of blood, born of the will of the flesh, and born of the will of man. Philpot concludes with a description of those who are truly born of God.",

Indeed, they that will have heaven must run for it. “They which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize…so run, that ye may obtain” (1Co 9:24). He understands that most are too casual in their approach to the Christian life. Their vigilance looks more like sloth too much of the time! Instead, Bunyan encourages us to “press toward the mark,” to “continue in the faith” in spite of all adversity, to remove hindrances, to beware of by-paths, to know the cross and mortification, to deny self, and to persevere. While this race is mentioned in most works on holiness, Bunyan’s focus is on the personal vigilance needed to complete the race, starting now, starting today.",

Though the unconverted may continually strive after the duties of religion, because of his unbelief he is headed for condemnation. Philpot closes with this admonition: \"I have drawn two opposite characters—their beginning, progress and end. Which are you? If an empty professor, unless grace prevent, your sentence is recorded, that you shall lie down in sorrow. If a living soul, though now you are walking in darkness, and have no light, you shall one day behold the face of God with joy.\"",

Finally, he warns all who seek or teach holiness that “There is no pride so dangerous, because none is so subtle or insidious, as the pride of holiness.” He ends with this plea, “Come let us flee to Jesus, and hide ourselves in Him until we be clothed upon with His humility. That alone is our holiness.”",

It is the day which has been made forever memorable by loosing the Redeemer from the pains of death. It is now the day in which His people are to celebrate the Saviour’s victory over the sepulchre. And therefore Christians must exclaim, “we will rejoice and be glad in it”: not only because of its appointment, but because of its occasion, for Christ’s resurrection was both for His own honour and for our salvation. Holy mirth, then, should fill our hearts at this season: Sabbath Days ought to be unto us as foretastes of Heaven itself. Then let us welcome each weekly return of it, and duly tune our hearts to show forth His praises therein.",

The departing from the faith has come as a consequence for not believing the Word of God is the “voice of the Lord your God” (Deu 8:20). Jesus said of these times that “because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold” (Mat 24:12). The coldness is a lack of real love for His Word, lacking any serious desire to obey it and to be conformed by it. Many claim to passionately ‘love the Lord,’ but without a manifest love for what He says. This effort is not to propose that I have the last word on music, but to take it out of the darkness of subjective reasonings and traditions of men, and place it in the light of the Word of God.—\nfrom the Forward",

His biblical insights regarding the first (regeneration) and the last (faith) are particularly valuable today because these two areas are frequently misunderstood by modern evangelicals. Regeneration, for example, is believed by many to be the \nresult\n of one’s “decision for Christ.” But as Pink shows, regeneration \nprecedes\n repentance and belief. Likewise—and also unlike what many believe today—faith is not something that can be produced at will, but is a gift of God given by the Holy Spirit. It is sometimes lamented that the Holy Spirit is the “forgotten” member of the Trinity; but forgotten or not, it is always profitable to study the Spirit’s work, especially His role in salvation as presented in this booklet.",

He also repudiates the assertion that Spurgeon, and those like him, teach that God drags men to Christ against their will. But since all men are naturally resistant, how does the Father draw them? According to Spurgeon, He sends the Holy Spirit to change men’s hearts so that they come willingly to the Savior without any compulsion whatever. How is this accomplished? Only God knows, but if the Holy Spirit’s influence is not brought to bear, “there never has been and there never will be any man who either can or will come to the Lord Jesus Christ.”",

Jonathan Edwards describes a hypocrite as a prayerless man. How far may hypocrites go? This compelling question is answered by David Clarkson, who shows that some can seem to be so close, yet be so very far away from heaven. Jonathan Edwards brings a stirring reminder that fear will overtake the hypocrite at the last Day. As Thomas Boston shows, a true Christian can be discerned by his heart religion.

He goes on to point squarely to the only real solution—humbling ourselves before God, our true and only means of deliverance. Newton ends with a heartfelt prayer for his nation. As Christians in America, we would do well to imitate his example as we find it in this sermon.",

Pink in this tract on God’s immutability (the Biblical truth that God does not change). He goes on to describe how God is unchangeable in His essence, His attributes, and His counsel (that is, His will). In conclusion, Pink brings the discussion down to the practical level by pointing out that the doctrine of immutability has a dark side as well as a light side—equally insuring performance of God’s promises and execution of His wrath. The result is solid comfort for believers and terror for the wicked.",

In the third article, John Calvin explains that we must look outside ourselves for the righteousness that God accepts. Charles Hodge gives a detailed study of the imputation of Christ's righteousness, defining the terms, proving the doctrine and examining apostolic arguments. Ebenezer Erksine follows with a brief overview of Adam's fall in the Garden and Christ's deliverance by obtaining righteousness for His people. In his second article, Bonar considers some objections to the doctrine of Christ's substitutionary work and imputed righteousness. Thomas Brooks gives us reasons for comfort, joy, and exuberant worship flowing from the imputation of Christ's righteousness to believers. Lastly, J. C. Ryle gives us some penetrating questions and answers for all to consider in the light of Christ's return.",

Ryle gives a helpful, clear, and biblical explanation of the fundamentals of Christ’s incarnation. John Flavel then gives us an extraordinary glimpse of Christ’s pre-incarnate glory—the glory and relationship of love that He had with His heavenly Father before the world began. Far too many Christians in our day think only of the Incarnation in terms of the babe in the manger, without relating it to God’s eternal purpose—His counsels and decrees; A. W. Pink helps us to overcome that shortsightedness. While we are on the subject of the pre-incarnate Christ, Lorraine Boettner gives us a useful survey of certain passages that point to Christ’s existence before time: Jesus made abundantly clear that His existence did not simply begin when He was born in Bethlehem. And Bethlehem—“little among the thousands of Judah”—was the very spot on which God’s eternal purpose of redemption became an historical reality. Horatius Bonar tells us, “At Bethlehem, our world’s history begins”—do we believe that? Thomas Boston helps us to understand the birth of Christ—the virgin conception, the sanctification of Christ’s human nature, the union of manhood and Godhead in the person of Christ, and \nwhy \nJesus had to be born of a virgin. The glorious doctrine of the Incarnation then unfolds with William S. Plumer, as he describes the greatest event that ever happened—God became man. With a second article, John Flavel explains the necessary humiliation of God’s eternal Son—its nature, degrees, and duration—showing us that Christ had to be greatly humbled before He was highly exalted. Charles Spurgeon gives us the last word: He explains that in the God-man, we may see all the attributes of God. But he would have us focus on \nthis\n glorious display: Jesus was full of grace and truth!\n \n...From the moment that God announced the woman’s seed that would crush the serpent’s head, history has moved unwaveringly toward one target: the day God would become man. And the God-man entered the world to do what God cannot do—and that is to \ndie\n. God’s incarnate Son died upon Golgotha to save His people from their sins. No incarnation, no \nhumanity\n; no incarnation, no \nsubstitution\n; no incarnation, no \ncrucifixion\n; no incarnation, no \nresurrection\n; no incarnation, no \nredemption\n—let us then shout for all eternity, “Praise God for the Lord Jesus Christ!”",

The one gift is “the unspeakable gift” where God spared not his Son so he could spare us. While the gift is one, it is infinite, the gift of all gifts. Furthermore, this one gift was given not for righteous men, but for sinners whose portion was condemnation. So the question comes—if God Is willing to give the ultimate gift to such as us, will He deny us any other needful thing? Clearly, the answer is no. He will “freely give us all things,”—that is, the many gifts.",

In such matters as the practice of evangelism, the teaching of holiness, the building up of local church life, the pastor’s dealing with souls and the exercise of discipline, there is evidence of widespread dissatisfaction with things as they are and of equally widespread uncertainty as to the road ahead. Without realizing it, we have during the past century bartered that Gospel for a substitute product which, though it looks similar enough in points of detail, is as a whole a decidedly different thing.

So begins Charles Spurgeon as he opens up Romans 8:34, laying out the reasons why the believer \ncannot\n be condemned. “Let me help you,” says Spurgeon, “by refreshing your memory with those precious truths concerning Christ, which show that believers are clear before the Lord.” These are fourfold: Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ is seated at the right hand of God, and Christ makes intercession for us. After discussing each of these in detail, he ends with an encouragement for believers, “Go away, ye that love Christ…with the savour of this sweet doctrine on your hearts.” And a warning for unbelievers, “Oh, you who have not trusted Christ, there is present condemnation for you.” Uttering a final plea for unbelievers to trust the crucified Lord, Spurgeon describes the happy outcome, “And with us you shall rejoice that none can condemn you.”",

The author’s design in this work is to bring our unclear thinking into sharp focus.

In the heart, it reveals the total depravity of our nature and our sentence of condemnation—leaving no room for doubt that we are powerless to save ourselves. Finally, Spurgeon demonstrates that grace greatly excels sin in both measure and efficacy. Just as we read in the second part of Romans 5:20, “but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.”",

His opponents had meant to silence him, but instead they perpetuated his ministry through the centuries: it was out of this period that most of his famous Letters came. Addressed to high and low, they were so prized by the recipients that the first collection by Robert McWard appeared in 1664, just three years after Rutherford’s death. The successive editions contained more letters until they grew to the 365 in Andrew Bonar’s classic edition.\n \nFrom this, “the most remarkable series of devotional letters that the literature of the Reformed churches can show,” the great leaders in the church as well as the humblest Christians have drawn strength. It is said of Robert Murray McCheyne that “the \nLetters of Samuel Rutherford\n were often in his hand.” Richard Baxter’s view was that, apart from the Bible, “such a book as Mr. Rutherford’s \nLetters\n the world never saw the like,” while to C.H. Spurgeon they were “the nearest think to inspiration which can be found in all the writings of mere men.” This abridged edition contains thirty of these letters.\n \n“You have heard of my trouble, I suppose. It hath pleased our sweet Lord Jesus to let loose the malice of these interdicted lords in his house to deprive me of my ministry at Anwoth, and to confine me, eight score miles from thence, to Aberdeen; and also (which was not done to any before) to inhibit me to speak at all in Jesus’ name within this kingdom, under the pain of rebellion. The cause that ripened their hatred was my book, whereof they accused me on those three days I appeared before them. But let our crowned King in Zion reign! By his grace the loss is theirs, the advantage is Christ’s and truth’s.”—\nSamuel Rutherford in a letter to Robert Cunningham, 1636.",

Calvin arrived in Paris in 1521 at the age of twelve to study for the priesthood. He struggled when confronted with the true gospel, was eventually converted, and ultimately forced to flee his native country because of Catholic persecution. In due course, he settled in Geneva where he pursued a many-faceted ministry through periods of both opposition (including banishment) and support from the local authorities. All the while, he labored over his most famous theological work, the \nInstitutes of the Christian Religion\n, revising it several times. Calvin died in 1564, leaving a remarkable legacy as “evangelist, pastor, reformer, theologian, and The Prince of Expositors.”",

His conscientious search for the truth of salvation through diligent study of the Bible led to the recovery of the biblical doctrine of justification by faith alone. His advocacy for reform in the Roman Catholic Church led to the Protestant Reformation, which spread throughout Germany, France, The Netherlands, Scotland, Sweden, and England, and became a major influence upon which Western culture is formed. Every Christian should be familiar with his life, and give thanks to God for raising him up for such an important time as the Reformation.\n \nThis is a reprint of chapter 5 in Reformation Heroes; complete 250 page book available from \nReformation Heritage Books\n.",

        "descricao": "The London Baptist Confession of 1677/89\n played an important role in Baptist history. The Act of Uniformity of 1662 made the new Anglican Prayer Book mandatory for use in all Anglican, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Baptist churches in England. Moreover, the Anglican church abandoned the Westminster Confession and returned to the Thirty-Nine Articles as its official confession of faith. Consequently, with the restoration of the Monarchy, the English Baptists suffered persecution for their faith. In 1677, a group of Particular Baptists met for the purpose of producing a more expansive confession than the previous Baptist confession of 1644. They modeled the Second London Confession on the Westminster Confession, but with significant theological differences regarding church government and baptism. Persecution kept the 1677 document from being officially endorsed by Particular Baptists until 1689, when the Toleration Act was passed. This act enabled religious freedom to co-exist alongside the established churches in England and Scotland. As a result, representatives from over 100 Particular Baptist churches met in London from July 3-11 to discuss and endorse the 1677 document. Though the confession was published in 1677, the General Assembly of Particular Baptist Churches adopted it in 1689; hence it is commonly known as “the 1689.” The Westminster Confession, the Savoy Declaration, and the London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 are considered the most important Reformed confessions arising from the English-speaking world.\n \n\"This little volume is not issued as an authoritative rule, or code of faith, whereby you are to be fettered, but as an assistance to you in controversy, a confirmation in faith, and a means of edification in righteousness. Here the younger members of our church will have a body of divinity in small compass, and by means of the Scriptural proofs, will be ready to give a reason for the hope that is in them. Be not ashamed of your faith; remember it is the ancient gospel of martyrs, confessors, reformers, and saints. Above all, it is the truth of God, against which the gates of Hell cannot prevail. Let your lives adorn your faith; let your example adorn your creed. Above all live in Christ Jesus, and walk in Him, giving credence to no teaching but that which is manifestly approved of Him and owned by the Holy Spirit. Cleave fast to the Word of God which is here mapped out for you.” \n—Charles Haddon Spurgeon to his own congregation in 1865",

Monod ends with these uplifting words, \"Looking unto Jesus always: thus awaiting the hour when He will call us to pass from earth to Heaven, and from time to eternity—the promised hour, the blessed hour, when at last 'we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is' (1 John 3:2).\"",

        "descricao": "For those who have a new heart, the Lord's Day truly is “a market-day of the soul.” With this in mind, this third Free Grace Broadcaster of 2015 is entitled \nThe Lord’s Day. \nThat great day is—at least it should be—a taste of glory divine and of the eternal rest that awaits all of God’s elect. What a blessing it is that God has ordered things so that once a week, after every six days of work, we have a day given to Him—one seventh of our time gloriously spent with the One Who loved us and gave Himself for us!\n \nThis issue begins with Arthur W. Pink, who gives us a glimpse of the origin of the six-days-of-work and one-day-of-rest pattern that God established in His almighty work of creation. J. C. Ryle offers a multitude of Scriptures from the Old and New Testaments that lay the groundwork for the seventh-day Sabbath and the first-day-of-the-week Lord’s Day. Thomas Boston gives a brief exposition of the Fourth Commandment, while Benjamin B. Warfield lays a biblical foundation for observing the Lord’s Day. Why do Christians worship on Sunday instead of Saturday? Archibald A. Hodge helps us to understand the biblical and historical shift from Sabbath to Lord’s Day. Ezekiel Hopkins then gives us a brief glimpse of how we worship on the Lord’s Day in \npublic\n, while William S. Plumer teaches us that our Lord’s Day responsibilities reach into the \nhome\n. Apart from worship in public and at home, what kind of works should we do on the Lord’s Day? Ezekiel Hopkins explains works of piety, necessity, and charity. Thomas Case wisely counsels us in honoring the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit on the day of worship. And, finally, Jonathan Edwards makes clear that the Lord’s Day was not given to us to be a burden, but a time of most precious enjoyment—truly a market-day of the soul.\n \nOur earnest prayer is that the Lord Jesus, Who died upon Calvary’s cross and rose again the third day, will fill all His children’s hearts with an earnest, honest, and Spirit-wrought love for His Day. Parents and grandparents, we urge you to meditate upon this and teach it to your children and grandchildren. Pastors and teachers, we urge you to preach on this much-neglected subject. And Christians everywhere, we urge you to love the Lord’s Day.",

It is not influenced by anything outside of Himself. It is eternal, sovereign, infinite, and immutable. It is holy—not regulated by passion or sentiment, but by principle.

He ends by pointing to man’s only real hope. “While we address the wills of men in gospel preaching, they are wills bound in the grave clothes of an evil heart. But as we speak, and the Lord owns His word, sinners are quickened to life by divine power.”",

To engage in it half-heartedly is an insult to God and man. Slumber must forsake our eyelids sooner than men shall be allowed to perish. Yet we, are all prone to sleep as do others...therefore have I sought to speak out my whole soul, in the hope that I might not create or foster dullness in others. May He in whose hand are the churches and their pastors bless these words...and if so I shall count it more than a full reward, and shall gratefully praise the Lord.”\n \n   —\nfrom Spurgeon’s Introduction to \nLectures to My Students",

What place does it have in our walk with Christ? These are some of the questions dealt with in this issue of the \nFree Grace Broadcaster.\n \nOur opening article by Arthur Pink introduces us to the doctrine of mortification. John Flavel follows by explaining what mortification is not and what it is. Benjamin Needler then teaches us how to search out and identify beloved lusts. Only Christians can truly mortify sin: this is the point of Horatius Bonar's article. John Owen, who wrote a penetrating, helpful book on this subject, gives us clear directions on how to mortify sin. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones shows us that we cannot accomplish this without the power of the Holy Spirit. Many great perils attend our neglect of mortification; Ezekiel Hopkins, who also wrote an important work on this, warns us of them. Ralph Erskine helps us discern the difference between legal and gospel mortification. Finally, Christopher Love explains how we may determine if we are in a state of mortification or not. May this issue of the Broadcaster encourage and help us all in this holy war against sin, which we will fight until we see Christ in all His glory!",

She was\n delighted \nwith this thought: “that I should be made a mother by thee.” She \nwanted\n to bear children with her husband. Nevertheless, her heart’s desire was not simply to bear children—even non-Christian women sometimes desire this. Her longing for a child was biblically focused on “that care I so exceedingly desired: I mean in Christian training our child.” She wanted to bear and bring up children for the Lord Jesus Christ. Bearing children in her day carried with it a high mortality rate for mother and child. Elizabeth was deeply concerned that she might die without the privilege of teaching her son or daughter about Christ and how to live for Him. How did she calm her realistic fears? She could have avoided this fear altogether by simply practicing birth control or by seeking an abortion (which was available then, though not as readily). But she found her comfort in God’s Word: “These fears were cured with the remembrance that all things work together for the best to those that love God (Rom 8:28) and a certain assurance that He will give me patience according to my pain.”\n \nStrengthened with biblical truth, she then wrote an astonishing letter to her unborn child, filled with instructions, biblical thought, and earnest exhortations for how to start, spend, and end the day to God’s glory. It was her Christian legacy to her unborn baby. She wrote detailed warnings, exhortations, and promises about everything from seeking God while a child, to starting and ending the day in prayer, to pursuing humility and modesty in apparel, to studying theology! She concluded the address to her beloved Tourell, “I hope God will so give me His grace that I shall more skillfully \nact\n than apprehend a mother’s duty… Thus, humbly desiring God to give thee all comfort in this life and happiness in the life to come, I leave thee and thine to His most gracious protection.” On October 12, 1622, she gave birth to Theodora. Nine days later, Elizabeth Joscelin died. She was twenty-seven years old.\n \nTo read Elizabeth’s letter is to step into a different world of motherhood than our own. Her legacy to her unborn child brims with biblical references; in fact, her very thinking seems to be saturated with Proverbs 31, Titus 2, and biblical womanhood. While she never had the pleasure of bringing up Theodora for Christ, her mother’s heart bares itself with astonishing beauty in her humble, but firm exhortations. Her burning desire to bear this child—fully knowing the risk—and her greater desire to bring up this son or daughter for Christ is the very essence of biblical motherhood.\n \nFor this reason, the theme of this Free Grace Broadcaster is \nMotherhood\n, a complement to last quarter’s \nFatherhood\n. Jabez Burns introduces us to the dignity of motherhood, something often lost to our culture. Thomas Boston briefly explores a mother’s main responsibility—a subject quite foreign to our post-Christian worldview. Peter Marshall develops something of a modern parable to show us our desperate need for a return to biblical motherhood. An almost forgotten Scottish Congregationalist named James Cameron gives us three articles—biblically training children, encouraging mothers, and calling mothers to Christ. John Angell James offers a further lo...",

In the myth of circumstantial freedom, he points out that one has the ability to make a decision, but not the power to carry out its purpose. In the myth of ethical freedom, he shows that the will of man is free from outside force, but not from the bias of human nature. And that bias is against God. Finally, in the myth of spiritual freedom, Chantry states that because man is at enmity with his Creator, his whole being hates God, His truth, and His rule. Conclusion: a new heart must be given him before a man will repent and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ.",

But there are others that, while they do not despise God’s salvation, are simply “neglecters of salvation.”\n \nAccording to Reade, this neglect can take three forms:\n \n \nLiving in the allowed indulgence of one known sin.\n \nBuilding on any other foundation than Jesus Christ and Him crucified.\n \nPreferring an earthly object rather than Jesus Christ.\n \n \nReade warns that any of these should excite alarm and call for strict self-examination.",

According to Pink, the inability of natural man does not spring from any physical or mental defect, but from the utter devastation which the Fall inflicted in four areas—man’s corrupt nature, the complete darkness of his understanding, the complete corruption of his affections (that is, what he loves), and the total perversity of his will.

First, one must have been regenerated and possess eternal life. Second, those who walk with God meet much opposition “for they will oppose the course of this world.” Third, they have the seal of adoption as sons and daughters of God the Father, the sovereign Ruler over heaven and earth. Fourth, they love God supremely and “cannot be satisfied without the friendship of God.” James ends with this lively encouragement: “As beggars dressed in the robes of God’s righteousness, we forget the trials of this lower land and soar and sing of Him Who ever loved us and made choice of us.”",

On the other hand, without the Spirit the work of men is futile. It will never produce true revival, for \"the Spirit is the Author of regeneration and sanctification\" — and both are necessary hallmarks of true revival. Finally, while we pray we must also work, because the \"children of the wicked one will not come to the light; it must be carried to them.\" In the end, Alexander notes, \"Every great awakening has proceeded from the Holy Spirit. Therefore pray for the Spirit.\"",

We see the minuteness of out Christian obligations; that there is not a temper, a look, a word, a movement, the most important action of the day, the  smallest relative duty, in which we do not either deface or adorn the image of our Lord, and the profession of His name. Surely if the book conduced to no other end, it tends to humble even the most consistent servant of God, in consciousness of countless failures. The whole book is a mirror for us all, not only to show our defects, but also [as] a guidebook and directory for godly conduct.”—\nCharles Bridges, from the Preface, 1846",

The Greek word “gehenna,” however, clearly does mean hell. Along with other chilling descriptions, Jesus repeatedly used this term to warn of eternal punishment for those who remain unrepentant. Despite some modern day denials, Scripture unequivocally describes hell as a place of physical, unquenchable fire which lasts forever and ever. In the end, Ross pleads for those who are without Christ to submit to Him by faith, “for redemption from sin, death, and hell.”",

As Lot’s wife, she was part of Abraham’s family and thus enjoyed the greatest exposure to true salvation in her time. But Ryle asks, “Yet what good effect had all these privileges on the heart of Lot’s wife? None at all. She lived and died graceless, godless, impenitent, and unbelieving.” This teaches us that privileges alone are not what men need; they need the grace of the Holy Ghost.

        "descricao": "According to James Heard, true repentance and true faith are products of regeneration by the Holy Spirit. He notes that there is also a false (or legal) repentance. This repentance arises from a fear of punishment, but is not accompanied by hatred of sin and self. So what does true repentance look like? It is a gift of God wrought in the heart so that a sinner is humbled by godly sorrow and abhors himself and his sin, crying out for forgiveness. It consists of three elements—a change of mind, a change of feeling, and a change of purpose. Heard uses the story of the prodigal son to illustrate these and then quotes Acts 3:19 to show the glorious results of repentance, “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out…”",

In a short preface, he humbly entreated God’s grace for help in keeping them. He also reportedly reviewed the resolutions once a week. The first one seems to summarize his overall purpose—“Resolved, that I will do whatsoever I think to be most to God’s glory, and my own good …and most for the good and advantage of mankind in general.” Other resolutions include speaking only the truth, temperance in eating and drinking, constantly studying the Scriptures, and much more. But most remarkable for such a young man were several resolutions which, in considering his own death, he resolved to live in such a way that there would be no regrets on that day. Edwards left us a beautiful 18th century example, one we would do well to emulate today.",

Where this is so, it is entirely out of harmony with biblical gospel proclamation. I urge you to sit down with your Bible and prayerfully, carefully read through the book of Acts. There we find genuine, Holy Spirit-filled preaching of the good news of Jesus Christ. You will observe there the prominence, sometimes even the primacy, of Christ’s resurrection. A dying Savior purchased our pardon; a living Savior proved the Father’s acceptance of His sacrifice! We must not separate these two glorious works of Christ, these two mighty pillars of the gospel.\n \nWith this in mind, we offer the latest volume of the \nFree Grace Broadcaster\n—\nResurrection\n. God’s people need this blessed, encouraging truth impressed upon their hearts. It is indeed food for the believer’s hungry soul. Charles Spurgeon leads the way by showing us the importance of the resurrection as gospel truth. Even in his day, many were straying from or distorting this essential doctrine. J. C. Ryle points out the remarkable contrast between the \nfact\n of the resurrection and the \nslowness\n of Christ’s disciples to believe it! Albert N. Martin then sets before us four truths about Christ’s rising from the dead that magnify its glory and splendor. What is the evidence for our Lord’s resurrection? William S. Plumer examines and details it for us, and then Thomas Manton describes the numerous benefits believers receive from it—what a treasure chest! That mighty preacher from the Great Awakening, George Whitefield, explains the power of the resurrection in the Christian’s soul, and David Martyn Lloyd-Jones demonstrates the crucial connection between Christ’s resurrection and the believer’s daily life. Finally, Charles Spurgeon gets the last word on this glorious subject: he tells us that Christ was the first to rise again and that the believer’s resurrection is guaranteed because of it! Let us praise the name of the Lord!",

Highlights include the first Holy Spirit revival on the day of Pentecost, the times of the Church Fathers, the Reformation, and the Great Awakening. Clearly then, God can certainly—and suddenly—bring the revival that we so desperately need in these dark days.

If sinners are saved then, it must be through a plan where God remains just and yet justifies the ungodly. And so it was that Christ kept the law perfectly and paid its penalty fully for His people so that they might be declared righteous. The author pleads with his readers, “If you are lost, let me urge you to acknowledge before God and men that you have no righteousness of your own, and trust Christ for the righteousness God has provided in Him.”",

Among other things, it is the righteousness of God, a righteousness without the law, a righteousness to which the Scriptures bear witness, and a righteousness perfectly suited to the unrighteous. Bonar then turns to justification by faith, pointing out that it is God who justifies the ungodly with a righteous, complete, irreversible, and divine justification.

Included was sending His Son to bear the sins of many, enlightening the world by gospel preaching, insuring the salvation of His elect and their sanctification, and creating and preserving His Church. Furthermore, every part of this was brought about independently of His creatures. Indeed, had God not taken salvation into His own hands, not a single fallen creature would ever have reached the kingdom of heaven. Griffin concludes by urging believers to leave all of their concerns to God, and entreating impenitent men to “seek ye the Lord while He may be found.”",

Sanctification is—1) the result of our union with Christ, 2) a consequence of regeneration, 3) certain evidence of the indwelling Spirit, 4) a sure mark of God’s election, 5) a thing that will always be seen, 6) a thing for which every believer is responsible, 7) a thing which grows, 8) a thing which depends on diligent use of Scriptural means, 9) a thing which does not exempt one from inward spiritual conflict, 10) a thing which cannot justify a man, yet pleases God, 11) a thing which will be absolutely necessary in the Final Judgment, and 12) a thing that is required to prepare us for heaven.",

Some utterly reject a place for God's Law in the life of New Covenant believers, while others love God's Law and find it a blessed rule of life. \n \nIn this edition of the Free Grace Broadcaster, A. W. Pink introduces our subject by asking crucial questions that inevitably arise regarding sanctification. Octavius Winslow offers a useful definition of the meaning of sanctification. J. C. Ryle then discusses the nature of sanctification, giving us a survey of its important elements. Winslow gives us a second article, explaining that all sanctification begins in Christ: His cross and atoning work, His intercession, and His Mediatorial fullness all lay the foundation and secure the sanctification of every believer. John Murray discusses the vital distinction between definitive and progressive sanctification. In his second article, Pink describes the two aspects of sanctification: mortification and vivification, both inseparable in the life of God's true children. Abraham Booth sets the motive of sanctification before us. Pink shows the difference between sanctification and justification. In two articles, Horatius Bonar shows us that holiness consists of the little things of life, and urges us to shine forth in reflection of Christ's glorious holiness.",

Sadly, many who are deluded by it will in the end hear the most terrifying words, “I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” Pink concludes with timely advice for us all, “How necessary it is then to find out where we really are; to examine ourselves and see whether we be in the faith.”",

Satan aims to find any vulnerability that will allow him to further his intent to injure the saint and spoil his usefulness, among other malevolent designs. He considers potential weak points including our infirmities, our state of mind, the objects of our affection, our position among men, and our condition in the world. So what is the outcome?

Brookes, a prominent dispensationalist premillennialist. In 1883 Scofield accepted the pastorate of a small congregational church in Dallas, Texas, which grew from fourteen to over five hundred members by 1895, when he became pastor of Moody’s church and headed Moody’s Northfield Bible Training School in Northfield, Massachusetts.

These facts are of such a nature as to be past finding out. They were hidden behind a veil, and until certain men who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost took away that veil, no mortal man could know them. This lifting of the veil of unknowing from undiscoverable things we call divine revelation.\n \n The Bible, however, is more than a volume of hitherto unknown facts about God, man and the universe. It is a book of exhortation based upon those facts. By far the greater portion of the book is devoted to an urgent effort to persuade people to alter their ways and bring their lives into harmony with the will of God as set forth in its pages.\n \n No man is better for knowing that God in the beginning created the heavens and the earth. The devil knows that, and so did Ahab and Judas Iscariot. No man is better for knowing that God so loved the world of men that he gave his only begotten Son to die for their redemption. In hell there are millions that know that. Theological truth is useless until it is obeyed. The purpose behind all doctrine is to secure moral action.\n \n What is generally overlooked is that truth as set forth in the Christian Scriptures is a moral thing; it is not addressed to the intellect only, but to the will also. It addresses itself to the total man, and its obligations cannot be discharged by grasping it mentally. Truth engages the citadel of the human heart and is not satisfied until it has conquered everything there. The will must come forth and surrender its sword. It must stand at attention to receive orders, and those orders it must joyfully obey. Short of this any knowledge of Christian truth is inadequate and unavailing.\n \n Bible exposition without moral application raises no opposition. It is only when the hearer is made to understand that truth is in conflict with his heart that resistance sets in. As long as people can hear orthodox truth divorced from life they will attend and support churches and institutions without objection. The truth is a lovely song, become sweet by long and tender association; and since It asks nothing but a few dollars, and offers good music, pleasant friendships, and a comfortable sense of well-being, it meets with no resistance from the faithful. Much that passes for New Testament Christianity is little more than objective truth sweetened with song and made palatable by religious entertainment…\n \n  —A. W. Tozer",

If we do not try ourselves, we can never know how it is with us. In the end, God will try us—and His trial will be according to truth.\nWhether our inquiry of ourselves proves we are truly God’s children or still in our sin-cursed condition, either discovery will be to our great advantage. If we find we have not grace, then the mistake is discovered, and the danger prevented. If we find we have grace, we may take comfort from the fact that we are heirs to “all the promises and in a state of salvation.”",

        "descricao": "A sermon on 2 Timothy 4:20.  \"These are among the last words of Paul the Apostle, for we find them in the closing verses of the last of his epistles. The chapter reminds us of a dying man’s final adieu to his best beloved friend, in the course of which he calls to mind the associates of his life. Among his memories of love we find Paul recollecting Trophimus, who had frequently shared with him the perils of rivers and perils of robbers which so largely attended the apostle’s career. He had left the good man ill at Miletum, and as Timothy at Ephesus was within an easy journey of him, there was no need to add a hint that he would visit him, for he would be sure to do it. The love of Jesus works in the hearts of His disciples great tenderness and unity. The overflow of our Lord’s great soul has saturated all His true followers with brotherly affection: because Jesus has loved Paul, Paul loves Timothy, and Timothy must needs love Trophimus. From this love there arises communion of feeling, so that in sympathy they share each other’s joys and griefs. When one member rejoices the body rejoices, and when one member suffers the whole body suffers with it. Trophimus is sick, and Paul cannot forget him, though he himself expects in a few weeks to die a martyr’s death. Neither would he have Timothy ignorant of the fact, though twice within a few verses he hurries him to come to Rome, saying, “Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me” (2Ti 4:9). If Timothy could not personally visit the sick friend, yet it was well that he should know of his affliction, for he would then remember him in his prayers. “Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God” (1Jo 4:7). Let us remember those who are one with us in Christ, and especially let us bear on our hearts all those who are afflicted in mind, body, or estate. If we have had to leave Trophimus at Miletum, or at Brighton, or at Ventnor, let us leave our heart’s love with him. And if we hear that another Trophimus lies sick not far from our own abode, let us accept the information as in itself a sufficient summons to minister to the afflicted friend. May holy sympathy pervade all our souls, for, however active and zealous we may be, we have not yet reached a perfect character unless we are full of compassion, tender-hearted, and considerate of the sorrowful, for this is the mind of Christ.\"",

It is a rough schoolmaster, I grant. But it is a real friend to man’s soul.” He goes on to describe some of the ways that God uses sickness for good and the special duties that its prevalence requires, concluding with some words of practical application.

        "descricao": "Preached at Enfield, Connecticut on July 8, 1741, this is perhaps the greatest sermon ever preached in America—and is certainly among the most well known. Owing to its forthright dealing with God’s wrath and His intense hatred of sin and the sinner, it is also one of the most controversial. Indeed, for more than three-quarters of the sermon Edwards lays down a relentless stream of the most vivid and horrifying descriptions of the danger facing unregenerate men. While it is difficult to read such graphic language, there is abundant hope in the sermon’s conclusion. Edwards puts it this way, “And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open and stands calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners.”\n \nWhile those who would rather ignore God’s justice in favor of His mercy condemn Edwards and his sermon, those who were present and actually heard him preach that day reacted in a decidedly different manner. According to the diary of Reverend Stephen Williams who attended the sermon, “Before the sermon was done there was a great moaning and crying through the whole House, ‘what shall I do to be saved; oh, I am going to hell, etc.’” The diary goes on to indicate that Edwards had to interrupt his sermon and come down to minister to those who were under such awful conviction. And so, in spite of what the scoffers might think or say, “the amazing and astonishing power of God” was manifested among the people that day—with many falling not into the hands of an angry God, but into the arms of a mighty Savior.",

Spurgeon next shows ways in which souls are won. He speaks first to preachers, urging them to believe in—and look for—instantaneous conversions and not to stray from the simple story of the cross. Lastly, addressing those who sit in the pews, he offers several practical suggestions including: bringing others to church, speaking to people one on one, writing letters, living the gospel, and praying.",

He continues by showing how this difference is evident in several spheres of Christian living which include reading the Scriptures, listening to the Word preached, prayer, conversing about the things of God, living a godly life, and passing out of this present world. Pink ends by showing in a few words what distinguishes a genuine Christian from one who is Christian in name only—not mere head knowledge, but a “God-given, Spirit-wrought faith in the heart.”",

He goes on to deal with interruptions of this peace, which include temptations of Satan, ignorance of true doctrine, unconfessed sin, and unbelief. Finally, Spurgeon gives good counsel on maintaining and gaining peace with God. To maintain it, one does well to look always to the cross of Christ, walk humbly with God, and walk in holiness, avoiding every appearance of evil. And for those who have never had peace with God, Spurgeon implores them, “Seek this peace and pursue it; and above all, seek the Peace-Maker, Christ Jesus, and you will be saved.”",

The church’s union with Christ is shown in its various steps or stages, of mediatorial, mystical, federal, vital, saving, practical, and experimental, culminating at the glory union in the glories of heaven. In his Introduction, Pink states, “The present writer has not the least doubt in his mind that the subject of spiritual union is the most important, the most profound, and yet the most blessed of any that is set forth in the sacred Scriptures; and yet, sad to say, there is hardly any which is now more generally neglected.”",

On October 14, 1855, Charles Spurgeon preached Sermon No. 46 to several thousand gathered to hear him at New Park Street Chapel. The sermon publication contained an announcement of this Catechism. The text that morning was: “Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations” (Psa 90:1).\n \n“I am persuaded that the use of a good Catechism in all our families will be a great safeguard against the increasing errors of the times, and therefore I have compiled this little manual...for the use of my own church and congregation. Those who use it in their families or classes must labor to explain the sense; but the words should be carefully learned by heart, for they will be understood better as years pass. May the Lord bless my dear friends and their families evermore…”—\nC. H. Spurgeon\n \nThe \nBaptist Catechism\n \nwas written in 1693 by William Collins and Benjamin Keach for teaching the doctrines of the London Baptist Confession of 1689\n.\n By 1738, this catechism was adopted by the Philadelphia Association of Baptists in America, the spiritual parent of all Baptist churches in the USA. Spurgeon edited and reprinted it in 1855, shortening the expositions of the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer. Thus, the catechism you hold in your hand is in essence the one used by Baptists in English-speaking countries to train their families for the last 300 years!",

Spurgeon’s message consists of Scriptural consolation and instruction, a caution not to confuse the work of the Spirit and the work of the devil, and finally an exhortation to those who are struggling to trust in Christ. He concludes by urging the latter to simply “Come as you are! Take Christ to be your all in all now.”",

All people are born into this world with an evil nature which manifests itself in a spirit of insubordination. Even after conversion, this rebellious nature is not entirely eradicated. Because of this, chastisement is needed to bring us into subjection to the Father. Pink examines various aspects of this subjection:\nFirst, it denotes an acquiescence to God’s sovereign right to do with us as He pleases.\nSecond, it implies a renunciation of self-will.\nThird, it acknowledges God’s righteousness and wisdom in dealing with us.\nFourth, it includes a recognition of His care and love for us.\nFifth, it involves an active performance of His will.\nIn the end, Pink reveals the two main reasons for this subjection—because He is our Father and because this is the secret of true happiness.",

Charles Spurgeon introduces this glorious subject of \nSubstitution, \nproclaiming the heart of the Gospel\n. \nArthur Pink instructs us regarding the covenantal aspect of Christ's substitutionary work. Spurgeon then masterfully explains the Great Exchange: the believing sinner's sin and guilt laid upon Christ; Christ's righteousness upon believing sinners. Pink then carefully explains how Christ's substitution is a \npenal \nwork. Octavius Winslow reveals how Christ's bloody substitution accomplished an entire pardon for His people. Piling up one Scripture upon another, John Owen gives us a delightful outline and summary of the Bible's revelation of sacrifice and substitution.

For example, two days before she died she said to her father, “I know that death’s pangs are on me, but I fear it not. He (Jesus) was three hours in death’s pangs Himself, and should He leave me the same time, I’ll get home at one o’clock; and oh, what a joyful hour.” As those of her household gathered around, her last request was this: “I have called you that I might see you once more, and exhort you for the last time to make \nsure\n of your interest in Jesus. \nTake\n Him, and you shall be happy in life and in death.”",

A special assembly was appointed to draft a new structure; it met at the historic Westminster Abbey (adjoining the Houses of Parliament) in London. The Westminster Assembly held 1,163 sessions between July 1, 1643, and February 22, 1649.\n \nThis \nWestminster Confession\n was drafted for the Church of England, and has become the most important of the great Protestant creeds of the Reformation era. It is a summary of major Christian beliefs in thirty-three chapters. Classic reformed biblical theology permeates the confession, with emphasis on the covenant relationships between God and man. A \nLarger Catechism\n was prepared by the Westminster Assembly, to be used by ministers in the pulpit for public teaching (1648). A \nShorter Catechism\n was published for instructing children.",

I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness\" (Psa 145:1-6). The subject of this issue of the Free Grace Broadcaster was chosen in 2004 after the devastation of Hurricane Ivan, in thankfulness to God for sparing Chapel Library. We pray it will be used by God to enflame your heart with thanksgiving to our great God. William Cooper, a Puritan preacher about whom little is known, introduces the theme of thankfulness by declaring why all men should be thankful. In another article he teaches us how to give thanks in everything, even affliction. Richard Sibbes, who inspired men such as John Cotton and David Martyn Lloyd-Jones, briefly describes thankfulness as the disposition of God's people. Thomas Manton explains the holy duty of thankfulness, while John Gill, with characteristic thoroughness, lists a catalogue of Christ-centered reasons for thanking the Triune God. In a message originally delivered to seamen, John Flavel shows how to give thanks for the mercies God has lavished upon us. Charles Spurgeon gives us three articles this time: he exhorts us to give thanks even in times of difficulty and then exposes ingratitude as a sin for which there is no excuse. He finally preaches from the story of the ten lepers whom Christ healed, in which only one returned to thank Him. We pray with all our hearts that your souls will be moved by this Broadcaster to greater and continual thankfulness to our merciful God. He has delivered our souls for ever in Christ Jesus. \"In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you\" (1Th 5:18).",

Liberal theologians and other professing Christians vehemently reject such a notion. Likewise, coupled with “in the room and stead of sinners,” it implies penal substitution and vicarious atonement, which are hotly debated and denied by other professing Christians. And, “in virtue of which pardoning mercy is secured to all who believe the gospel” implies election and particular redemption—doctrines utterly despised by some professing evangelicals. Much more could be said about and mined from this theologically rich definition, but the point should be clear: professing Christians do not agree on what the design, intent, and accomplishment of Christ’s death are. This is a tragedy, which becomes clearer when we ponder C. H. Spurgeon’s statement: “I do not believe we can preach the gospel…unless we preach the sovereignty of God in His dispensation of grace; nor unless we exalt the electing, unchangeable, eternal, immutable, conquering love of Jehovah; nor do I think we can preach the gospel unless we base it upon the special and particular redemption of His elect and chosen people that Christ wrought out upon the cross.” \n \nYour view of Christ’s atonement affects the way you think about God and His eternal purpose, the Person and work of Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit, and the way we preach the gospel—if indeed we are actually \npreaching\n the gospel. We earnestly pray that every reader will consider the work of Christ as we believe Scripture presents it and as some of the greatest preachers, evangelists, and missionaries that the world has ever known have preached it. Not all will agree with the contents of this FGB; but may we all love, praise, and adore the sovereign God of heaven and earth for the redemption accomplished in the atonement of Jesus Christ the Lord. May the Lord Christ be forever praised: “Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation” (Rev 5:9).\n \n--the Pastoral Letter, February 2014",

What we think about Jesus Christ affects not only questions surrounding the subsistence of the Godhead, but it also delves into entirely relevant issues, such as whether or not one should trust, obey, and worship Christ as God, the nature and efficacy of His atoning offices, as well as what constitutes a Church and what are its rites. He who believes in the divinity of Jesus Christ is a Christian; he who does not (whatever his profession) is a mere Deist. Without the Divinity, the Bible is, ‘the drama of Hamlet, with the part of Hamlet omitted.’ ” I wonder if we believe Dabney’s statements; or if, in our heart of hearts, we wonder if he is exaggerating just a bit? Is the doctrine of Christ’s deity that important? Really?\n \nIf we believe that the Scriptures are the inspired, infallible Word of God, then Jesus Christ is the foundation, the essential truth, of all that we believe as Christians. Mark Jones writes, “In theology, Christology has an importance that cannot be overstated. Christ’s person and work are the central point of Christian theology.” “Cannot be overstated”—it appears that Dabney and Jones agree on the importance of the \nperson\n of Christ, especially the crucial doctrine of the \ndeity\n of Christ. In fact, to ask, “Who is Jesus Christ?” is to ask the fundamental question that lies at the very heart of Western history. It is impossible to imagine that Christianity would ever have spread throughout the ancient world without one central truth burning like the sun at noonday—the man who died on Calvary’s cross and rose again the third day was and is truly and fully deity. “Jesus Christ is God” is the thought that changed the world \nforever\n.\n \nIt would have been interesting to hear the tone of voice with which Charles Spurgeon delivered the following statement: “I cannot see how Jesus Christ can be anything but one of two things—either the Son of God or else a gross impostor who allowed his disciples to think him divine and used the virtues of his character to support his claim…Either God or an arch-deceiver he must have been.”\n \nAt Chapel Library, we believe with all our hearts that from Genesis to Revelation the Holy Scriptures teach that Jesus Christ is God. Antitrinitarians and cults, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses; atheists and agnostics, such as Bart Ehrman; and numerous others have relentlessly attacked Christ’s deity. We therefore present the latest issue of the \nFree Grace Broadcaster\n—\nThe Deity of Christ. \nNumerous challenges presented themselves in bringing these articles together. Some of the most thorough articles in systematic theologies were highly technical, and unfortunately, often dry as dust! Such a glorious subject should fill our hearts with wonder, praise, and adoration rather than being an antidote for a sleepless night. On the other hand, articles that were more readable did not always deal thoroughly with the profound questions that have arisen over the centuries regarding this weighty and controversial subject. The resolution was to find readable articles and to move technical information to the footnotes; therefore, our readers will find more footnotes than usual. The subject was and is too vast and profound to cover well in forty-eight pages, so this FGB is merely a primer. Nevertheless, we pray with all our hearts that the reader will see something of the glory and beauty of the Word made flesh as these pages unfold.\n \nThe Puritan Isaac Ambrose introduces this FGB by declaring that one cannot find a more excellent subject to talk or write about than the person of Jesus Christ. Charles Hodge then gives us a brief survey of the OT teaching regarding Christ’s deity. Another Puritan, Thomas Brooks, demonstrates Christ’s deity by examining the honors due to God that the biblical writers bestow upon Jesus. Octavius Winslow examines the attributes and names of...",

Is sanctification a legal thing or an experimental?—that is to say, is it something the believer has in Christ or in himself? Is it absolute or relative?—by which we mean, does it admit of degree or no? Is it unchanging or progressive? Are we sanctified at the time we are justified, or is sanctification a later blessing? How is this blessing obtained?—by something which is done for us, or by us, or both? How may one be assured he has been sanctified: what are the characteristics, the evidences, the fruits? How are we to distinguish between sanctification by the Father, sanctification by the Son, sanctification by the Spirit, sanctification by faith, sanctification by the Word?” May the reader be illumined by the Holy Spirit as he finds the answers herein!",

It is a sacred, exotic herb which has grown very scarce.” Modern misconception tends to relegate self-denial to an ancient world of monasteries, hair shirts, and self-flagellation. However, as Watson shows, there is nothing more Biblical or Christian than true self-denial. “Self-denial is the first principle of Christianity. It is the life-blood which must run through the whole body of religion.” Christ calls us to deny our wills, our own righteousness, our appetites, our ease, our inordinate passions, our relations, our estates, and even our lives for Him. There is no alternative to a life of self-denial: “There may be going to heaven without comfort, but there is no going there without self-denial.”",

        "descricao": "The London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 played an important role in Baptist history. The Act of Uniformity of 1662 made the new Anglican Prayer Book mandatory for use in all Anglican, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Baptist churches in England. Moreover, the Anglican church abandoned the Westminster Confession and returned to the Thirty-Nine Articles as its official confession of faith. Consequently, with the restoration of the Monarchy, the English Baptists suffered persecution for their faith. In 1677, a group of Particular Baptists met for the purpose of producing a more expansive confession than the previous Baptist confession of 1644. They modeled the Second London Confession on the Westminster Confession, but with significant theological differences regarding church government and baptism. Persecution kept the 1677 document from being officially endorsed by Particular Baptists until 1689, when the Toleration Act was passed. This act enabled religious freedom to co-exist alongside the established churches in England and Scotland. As a result, representatives from over 100 Particular Baptist churches met in London from July 3-11 to discuss and endorse the 1677 document. Though the confession was published in 1677, the General Assembly of Particular Baptist Churches adopted it in 1689; hence it is commonly known as “the 1689.” The Westminster Confession, the Savoy Declaration, and the London Baptist Confession of 1677/89 are considered the most important Reformed confessions arising from the English-speaking world.",

        "descricao": "The purpose of this collection of articles is to press our hearts to honestly consider before heaven the dreadfulness of sin and the only hope for its pardon—Jesus Christ.\n \nTherefore, Arthur W. Pink begins with a brief, biblical definition of sin, followed by William S. Plumer’s excellent exposition of sin as an \ninfinite\n evil. Pink offers us a second article, explaining that there is nothing so vile as sin, as he describes its nature. Puritan Thomas Watson teaches us from vivid biblical descriptions that sin is a heinous thing, worthy of God’s just curse; while another Puritan, Ralph Venning, labors to show us that the heart of the sinfulness of sin is its relentless opposition to God; in fact, Venning says that if it could, sin would “ungod God.” A third Puritan, Samuel Bolton compares \nnatural\n evils—natural disasters such as plagues, hurricanes, and earthquakes—with \nmoral\n evil—sin—to teach us that sin is the greatest evil known to man! Watson then takes on the vital issue of degrees of sin, for many in his day and ours are deluded into thinking that God does not view one sin as greater than another. Furthermore, many of us have weak views of sin, so Edward Payson helps us to see that our sins are infinite, innumerable, and monstrous; thankfully, he points us to Jesus Christ and His redemptive work on the cross as the only remedy for the plague of our hearts. Again, pointing us to Christ, J. C. Ryle explains with great clarity our need for repentance from sin and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Charles Spurgeon displays the unknown depths of human sin and convincingly reveals that we really do not know what we are doing when we sin against God. The last word is from Octavius Winslow, who shows us that the one place where we may see our sins in all their depraved wickedness is the cross of Jesus Christ: from that extraordinary light, we will see our sins as they really are.",

Here is everything infinitely necessary to save and keep God’s people for all eternity! Everything! Appointed in eternity before Creation, sent into the world, incarnate by the miraculous conception in the Virgin’s womb, obedient to the Law, crucified, resurrected, ascended into heaven, and seated in glorious splendor at the right hand of His Father—Christ completed the work that His Father decreed before the foundation of the world. Here is the Surety, here is the Substitute come to die in horrifying agony upon the cruel cross of Calvary and to rise again by omnipotent power on the third day, conquering death, hell, the world, and Satan.\n \nEvery aspect and every detail of everything His Holy Father gave Him to do in order to save His people from the penalty, the power, the pleasure, and the presence of sin—everything—Jesus Christ accomplished it all.

It is his \nmagnum opus\n and has become one of Spurgeon’s most valued works. About it Spurgeon said in the preface: “The delightful study of the Psalms has yielded me boundless profit and ever-growing pleasure; common gratitude constrains me to communicate to others a portion of the benefit, with the prayer that it may induce them to search further for themselves. That I have nothing better of my own to offer upon this peerless book is to me a matter of deepest regret; that I have anything whatever to present is subject for devout gratitude to the Lord of grace. I have done my best, but, conscious of many defects, I heartily wish I could have done far better.” – \nC.H. Spurgeon",

The book is a Puritan classic: it is thorough, biblical, relevant, insightful, timeless, vital, God-honoring, convicting, and immensely important reading for every Christian. It is especially important for pastors, to restore to their preaching this fundamental doctrine.

He goes on to give Scriptural examples of those whose confession was self-serving and false, including Pharaoh, Saul, and Judas. Why were these confessions false? Because they were selfish, superficial, impulsive, and temporary. In true confession, the sinner—as far as he is able—comes to see sin as God sees it: a consummate evil and willful rebellion against God and His commandments. The truly repentant sinner draws near with an honest heart, in full assurance of faith, knowing that “if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins” (1 John 1:9).",

This gospel holds that one may “make a decision” to “receive Christ,” without bowing to His authority over one’s life. The problem is that many conclude: “a little sin won’t hurt—I’m just carnal, and God has saved me any way.” This false gospel leaves the professing Christian without any power over sin and a false confidence in heaven, even to the point of resisting calls to repent because “I don’t need to; I’m already saved.” Romans 6 is used to develop a Biblical understanding of self-denial, and passages in 1 and 2 Timothy are used to explain the deceitful nature of selfish sin.

Before the foundation of the world, apart from any merit in man, God chose a definite number of individuals for salvation and gave them to His Son. This is election.

He goes on to describe the real freedom that God mercifully provides. God's gift of freedom delivers us from our deadly bondage of sin. “When Jesus came to this earth, He came to set free all those who would repent and believe the gospel (Mark 1:15), to set them free from the bondage of sin and all that this brings.”",

In the first place, sinners are spiritually blind because “the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not…” (2 Cor 4:4). Only the Father can draw men to the Son. Secondly, sinners are spiritually dead because of their sins. Before they can come to Christ they must be regenerated by God’s Spirit. Finally, men won’t come to Christ because they hate God’s terms, which have always been repentance and faith. They will not abandon their rebellion until God has stripped them of all their self-righteous rags. Mahan ends with this plea, “God give us preachers today who will rout the sinners out of their refuge of lies and exalt the God of the Bible.”",

A long and dreary winter intervenes, and with winter comes the pruning knife of the heavenly Husbandman, who purgeth the vine.\" But after the winter of trial's difficulties in the pruning of the Lord, it brings forth the harvest of spiritual fruit.

He does this under three headings: there are such people in the church, these will be inspected by Jesus at the final judgment, and the results will be “very terrible.” Spurgeon concludes with a prayer that none of his hearers will suffer such a fate: “Holy Spirit, produce fruit in us this day, through faith in Jesus Christ our Lord!”",

He then lays out seven observations regarding this work: it is very unexpected, it tears down in preparation for a new creation, it is universal and complete in this tearing down, it is painful, it is inevitable, and finally, it is a prelude to great happiness. In the end, Spurgeon assures us that the result of all this—eternal life in Christ—will never wither!",

However, while this world is surely passing away, man is immortal. He will spend eternity either in great joy or in deep darkness and sorrow. So the critical question is this: how can a man make sure that his life after death will be spent in the light and joy of heaven? God has long since answered that question, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.”",

The Redeemer bade His disciples remember Him in His death, but there is not a word in Scripture, from Genesis to Revelation, which tells us to celebrate His birth. Moreover, who knows when, in what month, He was born? The Bible is silent thereon. Is it without reason that the only birthday commemorations mentioned in God’s Word are Pharaoh’s (Gen 40:20) and Herod’s (Mat 14:6)? Is this recorded 'for our learning'?

According to Boston, you should “fix your thoughts upon Him offered to you in the gospel as fully suited to your case.” That is, Jesus’ death on the cross perfectly satisfied the justice of God, bringing in everlasting righteousness for repentant sinners.

        "descricao": "In this short booklet, Charles Spurgeon explains that there is yet plenty of room for sinners to come to Christ. He then asks three questions: Where is there room? When is there room? Why is there room? Answering the first, he gives a lengthy list of \nwhere\n there is room including the fountain of Christ’s blood, the Father’s family, the church, and heaven. Regarding \nwhen\n there is room, his response is simple: right now there is room. Finally, as to \nwhy\n there is room, he offers another list which includes the “vast and wide” latitude of God’s decree of election and the infinite value of Christ’s sacrifice. Spurgeon ends with a prayerful request, “May God grant that many shall come to Jesus this very moment, for His dear name’s sake! Amen.”",

Not surprisingly, this portrait directly opposes modern views of the roles and behavior of women. Isenhour comments on Titus 2:3-5 which describes older women teaching young women to “love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed.” Throughout this tract, Isenhour expands on the admonition to be discreet, which he defines as “judicious, cautious; wise in conduct and management, especially as to matters of propriety and self-control.” He concludes with two observations: 1) a young woman who lives up to these qualities, lives a life of “nobility, beauty, usefulness and sublimity” and 2) to be a discreet woman “is more to be desired than education, fame, honor, and earthly glory.”",

Booth capably shows us from the Scriptures that this cannot be. When one comes to Christ, he dies to any hope of satisfactory law-keeping and enters into the all-sufficient grace of God freely bestowed. His love for Christ then motivates him in evangelical obedience to the moral law as part of his spiritual worship. Only then does he please God and worship acceptably. This message at once both liberates from legal bondage and replaces a false hope and insecurity with blessed confidence in the full and free salvation of our sovereign God.",

In a single page, Thomas Vincent enumerates the general responsibilities of a wife, according to the Scripture and the Westminster Shorter Catechism. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones examines a woman’s reverence for her husband and suggests that we should understand it as a “respectful deference.” Then in a detailed discussion, Ezekiel Hopkins gives a very helpful overview of a wife’s role as he describes what a respectful life should look like. Taking this theme even further, John Brown considers a woman’s submission, her pure conduct, and her inward ornaments. This article will take a little work and thought on the reader’s part, but it will richly pay back the investment. George Swinnock discusses a wife’s holiness and her husband’s praise for her, as well as what her submission includes. What happens when a woman’s husband does not obey the Word of truth? John Brown addresses this problem with hope in and help from Christ. Finally, J. R. Miller discusses a wife’s beautiful role in home-making and the reality that a godly husband will always find such a woman lovely in his sight.\n \nWe pray that the FGB on \nA Husband’s Love \ncoupled with \nA Wife’s Respect \nwill help Christ’s people everywhere to glimpse something of the beauty of marriage, when it reflects His sacrificial love and headship of His eternally loved Bride, the church. Ponder well the God-appointed roles of husband and wife.",

David Martyn Lloyd-Jones explains the unfolding of redemption through the descending and ascending of our blessed Savior. Isaac Ambrose describes \nthat\n Christ ascended, as well as \nhow\n, \nwhere to\n, and \nwhy\n He ascended, while William Plumer reveals the wonderful works of Christ at God’s right hand. What are some of the benefits of Christ’s heavenly session? John Gill shines Scripture light on this blessed work of our Lord. In a brief article, A. W. Pink surveys Christ’s intercession for the people of God. Part of Christ’s heavenly work at His Father’s right hand is the pouring out of the Holy Spirit: Jonathan Edwards believes that this is the sum and substance of Jesus’ blessings purchased for His people! Why did Jesus Christ ascend? John Flavel answers with six reasons. Then, in a second article from Spurgeon, we learn that Christ’s ascension declares Him victorious in finishing the work of redemption. Finally, Edward Payson asks us several penetrating questions about the Scriptures and Christ’s ascension: do we really believe the testimony of the Word of God about these astounding events?\n \nIt is our heart’s desire for God’s people to read with great joy the biblical witness of Christ rising into glory, sitting at His Father’s right hand, interceding for His eternally loved people, and sending the Holy Spirit on His great mission. Christ died on Calvary’s cross, rose again from the dead, and ascended into glory for His people. Ascension is a vital and cardinal part of the truth. We pray you will feast on its rich food.",

Charles Spurgeon introduces this subject with a helpful overview of the importance, practice, and benefits of biblical meditation. Thomas Watson defines what it is. Thomas Manton is convinced meditation is a biblical duty, and he tells us why. What is the nature of meditation? Isaac Ambrose answers that and describes the time, place, and matter of that holy practice. William Bates beautifully instructs us in occasional meditation, focusing on God’s creation, and George Swinnock offers five descriptions of solemn and set meditation on sacred subjects. Are there real dangers in neglecting this holy act of deep thinking? Edmund Calamy lists twelve! And they are sobering. John Owen, a deeply spiritually-minded pastor and theologian, presents us with practical helps for meditating upon God, and then A. W. Pink meticulously shows us how to approach a biblical text so that we can chew the Bread of Life. Are you new to meditation and wonder what to meditate about? In a second article, Thomas Watson gives a beautiful panorama of biblical themes to fix our hearts on, starting with God in eternity, progressing to Christ in history, and extending to heaven and hell. Then, Jonathan Edwards urges us to show our love to Christ; he does so by giving us a wonderful description of His loveliness. Spurgeon, a great advocate and practitioner of meditation, closes this issue by instructing us with sweet meditations of Jesus Christ our Lord. And how precious they are! Be forewarned: meditation is hard in our too-busy, distracted world; but this FGB is a brief “how-to” that we pray will fan the flames of your heart to seek the glory of Christ in Scripture and to love Him as never before.",

To do so, the Christian must learn to recognize the activity and deception of indwelling sin. He must lean upon the Holy Spirit to accomplish the work of mortification. His whole life and comfort in Christ depends on his engaging in this work daily and continually. In two excellent chapters, Owen explains common misconceptions about mortification, and what it actually is. Mortification requires both faith and whole-hearted diligence. The believer is warned about his danger when he allows himself to entertain even small habitual sins. Then Owen challenges the reader to enter the fight at the first sign of sin, to lean upon Christ and the perfect work of the Holy Spirit. “You must be always killing sin, or it will be killing you!”",

Charles Spurgeon declares that God’s act of predestinating sinners to the adoption of children is an act of pure grace. What are the causes of adoption? John Gill answers by demonstrating the gracious work of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as the cause of that miracle of grace. John Murray describes the Fatherhood of God biblically, distinguishing it from the false notion that all people are the children of God. He also explains that adoption is neither justification nor regeneration, while being intimately connected to both. Abraham Booth tells us that God’s grace reigns in adoption and offers clear biblical ways that believers are united to God and made part of His heavenly family. What is the nature of adoption? And what are its benefits? Do you know? David Martyn Lloyd-Jones explains both with biblical clarity and the force of truth. Scottish theologian and minister John Dick sharply contrasts the satanic family of which believers were once a part with the glory and splendor of being in God’s righteous family. How does one know if he or she is indeed a child of God? Octavius Winslow beautifully explains the witness of God’s Spirit in our souls that we know that we \nare\n the children of God. Then, with clarity and moving imagery, John Eadie makes a valiant attempt to tell us what it means when the apostle John says, “We shall be like him”—like Christ Jesus! And finally, Thomas Reade helps us to consider the sacred evidence of sonship. He, like Winslow, wants to help us answer the question, “Am I a child of God?” No regenerate soul can read these thoughts without being moved and without desiring to finish his course to the glory of Christ Who saved us.",

It is needed in our day when, in many cases, submission in marriage has become either oppressive or irrelevant. \nBut to honor our spouse is to honor the God of marriage and the covenant of marriage. Fulfilling our God-assigned roles is a matter of faithfulness to God. Two principles underlie mutual submission: Christ and His Church, and the marriage covenant. The love of Christ for His Church and the Church’s joyfully following Christ are the foundations for biblical submission. Submission is Christ-honoring when we see it as a vital part of covenantal commitment. This booklet is important for those who are married and those preparing for marriage.",

God calls His church to worship Him according to His commands and the apostolic example, not our good ideas. The history, biblical context, function, and limitations of the regulative principle are discussed in detail. While God’s people throughout history have often seen the regulative principle as focused on worship, this study demonstrates that a more biblical approach will also emphasize that the church, its organization, and its functions should be carefully regulated by Scripture as well. This emphasis helps to clarify issues and objections that relate to this vital doctrine.",

However, to understand, believe, and love the good news about the crucified and resurrected Savior, we must first understand our condition.

Arthur Pink introduces us to this weighty subject by asking the question, “Is man a totally and thoroughly depraved creature by nature?” Thomas Reade then tells us about the deadly consequences and bitter fruits of Adam’s fall: in Adam all die. We then consider Joel Beeke’s helpful survey of the doctrine of human depravity. A second article by Thomas Reade leads us to a painful truth: the heart of man is evil. But he does not leave us there: he takes us to the blessed Son of God for deliverance. John Owen describes with great clarity the depraved and corrupted state of man’s mind and teaches us that the only remedy for this great darkness is the new birth: “You must be born again.” Loraine Boettner explains the extent and effects of original sin, which results in human inability in the matters of salvation. What is our true spiritual condition outside of Christ? Charles Spurgeon declares that we are legally, spiritually, and eternally dead. Nevertheless, he also tells us that we can be legally, spiritually, eternally alive by faith in Jesus Christ the Son! We then hear from John Flavel that in mercy, grace, and love, God draws sinners to Jesus Christ, gradually, suitably, powerfully, effectually, and finally. That is indeed good news! J. C.

Benjamin Keach gives us a wonderful overview with heart moving, biblical thoughts. In the first of three articles, John Owen introduces us to communion with the Father. Matthew Barker offers another article by helping us to obtain and maintain that holy communication with our Savior and Lord. Owen then gives a wonderful glimpse at what communion with Christ looks like, sprinkling his text with the Song of Solomon. Can we honestly say that we hunger and thirst, even yearn and long for God’s presence and fellowship? Thomas Brooks beautifully lays out what the regenerate soul seeks after. In his last article, Owen gives a very brief look at communion with the Holy Spirit—a practice that is probably rare for many. John Flavel fills our hearts and souls with the loveliness of the heavenly privilege that we have in communion with God. And Thomas Brooks brings this issue to a close by calling us to keep our communion with God alive and healthy as a sound defense against Satan’s snares.",

        "descricao": "We who profess to be the blood-bought people of God really must answer the question, “Am I spiritually minded?” To help us answer biblically, Charles Simeon introduces us to the subject of carnal minds and spiritual minds. John Owen then explains what spiritual mindedness is. D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones gives us a powerful exposition of what a carnal mind is, and why it is death. Another question, which is foundational to this subject, is, “Do you have God’s Spirit?” J. C. Ryle answers that question, listing what the Holy Spirit produces in the life of believers, which includes making them spiritually minded. It is true that spiritually minded people have carnal thoughts, and carnally minded people have spiritual thoughts. But spiritually minded people long to be free from carnal thinking, and Jeremiah Burroughs arms us for that battle. What then is the evidence of a spiritual mind? John Owen speaks directly to that question in his second article. And then Jeremiah Burroughs guides us with sound biblical principles for cultivating a spiritual mind. This FGB closes with three articles that give God’s children important things to think about: Thomas Manton urges us to think about death. Samuel Davies points out the folly of not contemplating life in this world in the awesome light of eternity, for every one of us will spend eternity in hell or in the glories of Christ’s holy presence and everlasting joy. Finally, Thomas Reade lifts our eyes of faith and fastens them on heavenly joys. Can you imagine anything better to meditate on than the attributes of the Triune God Who saves us; the Prophet, Priest, and King Who has done everything infinitely necessary to redeem and preserve us for His glorious kingdom; and the Holy Spirit Who births us into that kingdom and empowers us for our journey to the Celestial City? Friend, do you love God with your mind? Think about it.",

Octavius Winslow introduces this crucial subject, proclaiming time a solemn, priceless gift. Jonathan Edwards wholeheartedly agrees and reminds us that eternal happiness or misery depends on how we use time. A. A. Hodge then briefly offers definitions of God, time, and eternity. Do we think of time as opportunity? Richard Baxter says yes, we should, and gives numerous reasons to support his answer. Following that, David Martyn Lloyd-Jones calls us to heed Paul’s exhortation to buy up opportunities to serve the Lord Jesus. Baxter, again, is not likely to win many friends among modern Christians as he strongly exposes time thieves that rob us of our precious gift; but you should read him carefully, pray earnestly, and examine your heart by Scripture before you write him off. Lloyd-Jones urges us to recognize the true differences between believers and the lost world, arguing that the way believers use their time should be a witness to the lost. Charles Spurgeon asserts and affirms from Scripture that our time is limited and short: how we use every second matters. Jeremiah Burroughs makes alarmingly clear that our abuse of time may lead to our most dreadful loss—the loss of our never-dying souls for eternity. Finally, Spurgeon declares the good news that Jesus Christ died on Calvary’s cross and rose again to save sinners. But you must believe that astonishing good news now, now, now! So, what time is it, friend? It is time to repent, believe, and be saved; or it is time to serve the Lord Who loved and gave Himself for us. You may not have another day for either. We urge you: make the time to meditate on this vital subject—the last grains of your hourglass are running towards eternity. \nNow\n is the time.",

The basis of the treatise is taken from Romans 7:21, where indwelling sin in believers is in the character of “a law,” whose seat is the heart and whose nature is enmity against God. Sin acts consecutively in withdrawing the mind from what is good, through positive opposition to God, by ensnaring the soul in captivity, and lastly by filling it with hatred to the principles of holiness. The power of indwelling sin is seen in its deceitfulness, developed in three stages using James 1:14-15: the mind is withdrawn from obedience; the affections are enticed; and actual sin is then committed. Its power in the believer’s soul is seen further by observing its effect in unregenerate persons, its resistance to moral law, and our fruitless attempts to subdue it in our own strength. Owen’s goal is that we become vigilantly watchful in consistently opposing sin and successful in waging war with sin through applying the sin-conquering truths of Christ’s gospel. Many consider this book (together with his \nMortification of Sin\n and \nTemptation\n) essential for Christians of all ages who desire to walk with the Lord in true biblical holiness.",

In a truly provocative article, John D. Wells reveals why the sickbed is not favorable for finding eternal life. Following that, Puritan George Swinnock reminds us of our biblical duty to visit and minister to the sick: it is not merely a pastoral work but an act that Christ will mention in the Day of Judgment! In a second article, Ryle asks hard questions and presses our consciences with biblical duties to help us prepare ourselves to honor Christ, examine ourselves before Christ, and commune with Christ in our times of sickness! Lastly, in my opinion, no uninspired writer brings the sweetness of Christ to the subject of sickness as beautifully as Charles Spurgeon. And he exhorts us, “If Jesus loves you, and you are sick, let all the world see how you glorify God in your sickness.

So, let us think about, talk about, pray about death. To urge you in that direction, we present the latest issue of the FGB: \nDeath and Dying\n. Christopher Bogosh introduces the subject by describing the three deaths found in Scripture: physical, spiritual, and eternal. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones tells us that, contrary to the modern view, the Bible clearly teaches that death is not the cessation of existence and that the human soul is immortal. Charles Spurgeon explains that death is our enemy, which entered human experience by sin; but Jesus Christ has conquered it! Christopher Bogosh then challenges the modern idea of brain death and gives us instead the testimony of God’s Word about death. Robert M’Cheyne tells us that the world fears death and what follows it; but our heavenly Father and the Holy Spirit declare, “Blessed are the dead.”  Do you think about death? Have you ever meditated on death? Thomas Boston explains meditation step-by-step and then gives a wonderful example of a meditation on death. Now, what if you died in your sins this year? Have you considered what you would lose in this world and in the world to come? Samuel Davies presses us to consider our eternal loss if we die in our sins. For many, preparing for death means a will and an insurance policy. But a third provocative and helpful article by Christopher Bogosh teaches us how to pray to prepare for death—praying for clear evidence of salvation, for renewing the inner man, and for being equipped by God to face death without fear. Christians are never surprised to learn that unbelievers fear death and are unwilling to die. But the same should not be said of believers! To our surprise, many believers seem to be unwilling to die. Thomas Brooks applies the Scriptures to move us, not only to be willing to die, but to heartily desire it! Last of all, death is a part, a terrible part, of God’s curse upon sin. Nevertheless, Octavius Winslow paints the preciousness of the believer’s death with such glorious strokes that our hearts are swept into breathtaking, majestic scenes of God’s love for us, God’s desire for us, God’s joy in us, and Christ’s triumph for us! Read prayerfully, it should make you pant for death and eternity with the resurrected Lord of glory! I am going to die. So are you. And our inescapable appointment is one day closer. But the King of kings has conquered the King of Terrors: Let us die well, trusting Christ.",

Ryle introduces us to the subject of heaven with a brief account of that divine region from the lips of Christ Himself. Edward Donnelly beautifully describes heaven itself as the place of God’s glory. Paul Helm shows us that, based on Scripture alone, heaven is redemptive, fixed, and final. Few people have ever had the great gift of describing the things of Christ with such beauty as did Charles Spurgeon. His vision of the Beatific Vision and the glory of seeing Christ should stoke the longing soul with living hope. Heaven, that place of God’s glory, is a world of love, says Jonathan Edwards—a place where we will, in love, all be filled with the fullness of God. Thomas Brooks picks up where Spurgeon leaves off, expanding on the glory of our experience with God the Father and Christ the Son: the best and choicest presence of God and Christ is reserved in heaven! Thomas Reade enriches our hearts with meditations on heaven. Meditate here, friend, and set your hearts on fire with the hope that lies before us. What is your vision of heaven? Is it robes, harps, and sitting on clouds forever? Derek Thomas paints a challenging biblical picture of the new heaven and the new earth. Edwards, in a second article, tells us how to seek that blessed world of love and how to avoid hell, the world of hatred. And last, we complete our journey to the Celestial City with a portion from John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress.",

In a second article, Pink directs us to where election begins—in the eternal purpose and will of almighty God. In harmony with Pink, Wilhelmus à Brakel gives us a helpful glimpse of the decrees of God. In a third article, Pink displays the glory and beauty of Jesus as the first elect of God and as the Holy One in Whom all others are chosen. Joel Beeke and Paul Smalley then give us an extended biblical explanation of election. Then, in a second article, Robert Purnell once again gives us a concise overview of reprobation. Following that, Lorraine Boettner unfolds the solemn biblical account of reprobation. How do election and evangelism work together. Southern Baptist Robert Selph explains this clearly and briefly—it is not as complicated as many make it. But how does one know if God has chosen him or her to everlasting life? Thomas Reade answers with verve, beauty, and encouragement. Lastly, Octavius Winslow shows us the glorious truth that all God’s people were chosen to be like Christ Jesus, our lovely and blessed Savior. What a glorious, encouraging, and thrilling thought! Whatever you think of these two doctrines, we pray that you will ponder them prayerfully and see the immensity of God’s amazing grace in Christ. “Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God” (Rom 11:22).",

Benjamin Beddome introduces us to our Sovereign by showing how His great works of creation and providence are related. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones defines providence by examining its three elements—preservation, government, and concurrence. Then, Arthur W. Pink explains the meaning of the Godhood of God and why it is crucial for Christians to understand it in opposition to the dignity, power, and attainments of man. But what is providence like and from what does it arise, properly understood? William S. Plumer tells us that God’s providence is like God’s nature—holy, just, benevolent, wise, sovereign, stable, and irresistible! Pink then explains so beautifully that God rules everything—all inanimate matter, irrational creatures, human beings, and all angels, good and evil. How can such a lofty doctrine be practical to believers? Joel Beeke gives us sound answers from the infallible Scriptures and from the Puritans. To compliment those answers, Thomas Watson gives biblical instruction in the ways that our sovereign God works all things for good to His eternally loved people. There is one aspect of providence that especially thrills the heart of all believers: how God worked in His sovereign, powerful, and mysterious ways to bring them to saving faith in Christ and to everlasting life! John Flavel reminds us of that astonishing work and the surprising mercies of God’s grace! Lastly, Thomas Reade concludes our subject by filling our souls with a glorious vision of God’s absolute reign by Christ Jesus in our hearts.",

You will hear from Lutherans, Presbyterians, and Particular (Reformed) Baptists—all of them struggling to answer church/state questions from the Word of God. \r\rWe begin with Chapter 24 of the 1677/89 Second London Baptist Confession: “Of the Civil Magistrate.” Jean-Marc Berthoud explains two types of power: the magistrate and the church. John Calvin declares that God has ordained civil magistrates for humanity’s good. Pierre Viret discusses the three major forms of government: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy—which is best? R. C. Sproul explains that the essence of civil government is force. Is government authority absolute? H. Rondel Rumburg argues that it is delegated, not absolute power. He also discusses the Social Contract Theory. Christopher Goodman examines true obedience when facing civil or religious oppression. The important doctrine of the Lesser Magistrates has been forgotten by modern believers as well as unbelievers; but Matthew Trewhella teaches us its biblical importance. Building upon that doctrine, which the Reformers and Puritans held, we have extraordinary examples of it in the Magdeburg Confession, John Knox, and Isaac Backus—Lutherans, a Presbyterian Reformer, and a Baptist! Finally, Samuel Davies tells us about the greatest King—Jesus Christ; and he takes us by the hand to show us the glories of Jesus’ kingdom. Jesus rules over all the kings and kingdoms of men. He alone is King of kings and Lord of lords!",

Prayer obtains great things from God and is the very friendship of the soul with God.  But what is the heart of prayer? Is there an essence to prayer without which “all your lifting up, both of hands, and eyes, and voices, will be to no purpose at all”? Yes. And the God who hears prayer has left us plain instruction about the living essence, the beating heart, of prayer. John Bunyan finds the key in the Apostle Paul’s words: “I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.” He begins with a memorable definition of prayer. Then he explores the two great aspects of the heart of prayer: prayer with the Spirit, and prayer with the understanding. May this sermon in booklet form bear the fruit of Spirit-empowered prayer for God’s glory and the joy of God’s people everywhere.",

Ryle opens this profound subject by explaining that the key to Bible knowledge is Jesus Christ. The articles that follow use Christ’s three-fold division of the OT: law, psalms, and prophets. Charles Spurgeon preaches the “first gospel” from the Law in Genesis 3:15, the gospel of the serpent’s doom! Likewise, George Whitefield reveals Christ to us in the account of Abraham’s obedient attempt to sacrifice Isaac. Christ’s sufferings were prophesied throughout the OT, and Jonathan Edwards shows us that in detail. William Plumer explains that we might see Christ where He is not and miss where He is in the Psalms if we interpret Scripture poorly. John Calvin then interprets Psalm 2 well to show us that Christ is the Son of God declared there. Matthew Henry takes us to Christ in the Prophets, beautifully mining Christ from the gold of Isaiah.  Charles Simeon also shows from Isaiah that God the Father called and commissioned Christ as His anointed preacher. Is the gospel really in the OT? The law, the psalms, and the prophets overflow with it: James Durham proclaims Christ and His gospel from Isaiah; George Whitefield turns to Jeremiah to draw our hearts to Christ our righteousness; and Richard Sibbes takes the majestic text of Malachi that shines with the glory of Christ the Sun of Righteousness. We close with Charles Spurgeon telling us that on the road to Emmaus, Jesus was the best of tutors, teaching  from the best of books, and explaining the best of subjects—His own Person and work.",

Following that, William Fenner demonstrates that every person has a conscience and gives further reasons why God gave it to us. In a second article, Arthur Pink helps us understand that our conscience has been corrupted by sin, that it is only able to work according to the light that it has, and that its operations are faulty. John Flavel takes us deeply into the sin-burdened conscience, and what a journey that is! He writes of the burdensome sense of sin, the memories of our sin, and the condemnation of conscience. In his second article, William Fenner informs us that ministers must know the spiritual state of their flocks to properly minister the Word to the conscience of God’s people. Again, John Flavel reveals the misery of a conscience in hell—a damned conscience. Yes, friends, consciences will follow the lost to hell. Mercifully, in his third article, Pink takes us into the comforting realm of a good conscience: how do we obtain one, what are its characteristics, and how do we maintain it? J. C. Ryle than tells us that nothing in our gospel-war against sin is better calculated to quiet, soothe, and comfort a raging conscience than justification by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. Finally, Charles Spurgeon warns against using outward practices and a little bit of religion to quiet our conscience: that can be eternally deadly. As always, the joy of salvation and the heaven-on-earth of a peaceful conscience are found only in the finished work of Christ and the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit.",

The Lord wanted His gospel call to salvation to spread throughout the world. Jean-Marc Berthoud teaches us about the importance of Christ’s authority in local churches. Now, do pastors, elders, and undershepherds have real authority in Christ’s churches? Arthur Pink clearly affirms and explains the necessity of such authority. In accord with this, elders have the responsibility of preaching God’s authoritative Word to Christ’s blood-bought people, ever setting the beauty and glory of His crucifixion and resurrection before them. Fathers too have authority, and Richard Baxter shows them how to use it to the glory of God and the good of their families. What about civil government?

In the same stream of holy, soul-elevating thought, John Flavel announces to the world that Christ’s precious blood has such great efficacy that by it God can forgive the greatest sinners! Charles Spurgeon adds that believers are not sanctified by the works of the law, but by the holy and precious blood that streamed from Jesus’ head, hands, and feet. In his second article, Thomas Brooks takes us to the throne of grace and shows us that our privilege of prayer was purchased by Christ’s blood. Spurgeon then magnifies Christ’s blood in the Lord’s Supper (meditating on this would be a great preparation for the next time you dine at Christ’s table!). Flavel then boldly proclaims that Jesus Christ is the only physician of sin-sick souls! O what a great Physician He is for the guilt stricken, sin-laden sinner! George Swinnock lifts our hearts to embrace and rejoice in regeneration, the Holy Spirit’s miracle purchased by Jesus’ precious blood.

        "descricao": "I often rise early in the quiet of morning to walk the streets of my neighborhood, praying for my neighbors. On one occasion, a man came out of his abode, and I struck up a conversation with him. I asked, “How can I be praying for you?” He answered, “Pray for world peace.” Here, I thought, was an open door to preach the gospel. I said, “I will be glad to pray for world peace, but that will only happen when the Prince of Peace reigns in every human heart.” I was not looking for a debate on end-times matters. I just wanted to tell him about the Prince of Peace, Who died on the cross at Golgotha as the sin-bearing Substitute of His people; the Prince Who rose again triumphantly the third day; the Prince Who secured eternal peace with God by shedding His blood for sinners. I wanted my neighbor to know that true peace came only by faith in Jesus Christ the Lord—peace with God and peace with others. His previous experiences with modern churches, however, left him uninterested. He smiled and went back inside his home. He was looking for another kind of peace.\n \nJesus spoke of two kinds of peace: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you” (Joh 14:27). The world offers seasons of peace—short seasons without war or calamities. Marxists, Islamists, New Agers, Globalists, and others promise worldwide peace. Of course, what they mean is that the world will be at peace when they rule it. Promised peace attracts diehard, even fanatical, devotees in vast numbers. But man’s depraved nature never has and never will bring lasting peace to this world. My neighbor will be disappointed with the peace the world offers.\n \nIn stark contrast to the failed human efforts for peace, anyone who repents of his sins and believes on the crucified and resurrected God-man Jesus Christ can and does know a peace with God that can never fade away. Consider Paul’s exhortation to the Philippians: “In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Phi 4:6-7). Peace that passes all understanding—Paul knew experientially about that peace, even as he wrote to the Philippian believers from prison. He knew, as God’s children know, that Christ’s peace cannot be taken from us. Arthur Pink illustrates that peace: “A tyrant once threatened a saint, ‘I will destroy your home’—you cannot destroy my peace. ‘I will confiscate your goods’—you cannot rob me of my peace. ‘I will banish you from your country’—I will take my peace with me.” O my friends, do you know that peace? Do you quiet your heart with Christ’s peace regardless of the providential experiences that come your way?\n \nTo encourage all Christ’s blood-bought people with this great peace, we offer this quarter’s Free Grace Broadcaster: \nPeace\n.",

Have you time for business, for company, for folly, for pleasure, for lusts, for sin, but none for prayer? Have you time for the shop, the market, the ballroom, the card table, the public house, the political club—but none for prayer? You can spare days and weeks for the things of time.

        "descricao": "This issue of the FGB is about \nYour Adversary\n, since every Christian needs to know who we are facing in this spiritual battle. Arthur Pink’s first article asks a question: Is the devil just a figment of our imagination? Pink answers that the Word of God gives conclusive evidence that the devil is real. David Martyn Lloyd-Jones gives us a biblical survey of the Bible’s teaching about our adversary the devil. In a second article, Arthur Pink gives us a clear and helpful biblical exposition of the personal characteristics and acts that prove the devil to be a real person. Thomas Manton reveals that Scripture tells the story of the raging war between Satan and God’s people down through the ages. Charles Spurgeon warns believers and urges them to realize that Satan watches and considers the weaknesses of believers; based on those weaknesses, he plans his temptations and attacks. Thankfully, Thomas Brooks then gives us ten helps against Satan’s devices and schemes. This is a wonderful list of stratagems against the adversary’s cunning tricks and traps. We also see how to resist the devil in William Perkins’ fictional dialogue between Satan and a Christian. Jonathan Edwards unfolds the extraordinary wisdom of God in the way He outwitted and overthrew our adversary. In his second article, Spurgeon gives us the ultimate weapon for overcoming Satan—the blood of Jesus Christ the Lamb of God. What a feast and encouragement for the beleaguered soul! And once again, Jonathan Edwards cheers and strengthens our hearts with knowledge that the days of our suffering physically and spiritually by the schemes and attacks of Satan will end with the adversary cast into the lake of fire for eternity. The last article in this issue leaves us with a warning about Satan’s devious, unrelenting warfare against the unity of Christ’s blood-bought people. O children of God, let us love one another as Christ loved us (Joh 15:12): let us not “bite and devour one another” (Gal 5:15), which is our adversary’s work; but let us exalt Christ and defeat our adversary by keeping “the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Eph 4:1-3).",

Thomas Smyth offers us twelve rules for promoting harmony among church members, and another article by Anthony Burgess exhorts ministers to seek unity among themselves. The unity of pastors and members of Christ’s churches is important; Andrew Fuller guides in securing it. In his third article, Burgess expounds the excellence of unity and how it brings the world to believe the truth of Christ’s saving mercies.

Ryle introduces this crucial subject with Christ’s question to Peter: “Lovest Thou Me?” Thomas Vincent explains why true Christians love the unseen Christ. Following that, Jonathan Edwards lists biblical motives to love Christ. Charles Spurgeon declares that love for Christ is the great test for confirming that we are children of God. Ryle, in his second article, identifies the marks of love for our precious Savior. In Spurgeon’s second article, he asserts reasons to love Christ and the consequences of being without love for Him. Edwards follows with a second article that describes God’s dreadful curse on those who do not love Christ. Vincent then helpfully gives an overview of how to examine and prove our love for Jesus. In his third and final article, Ryle asks a heartfelt, probing, and personal question that we must all answer: Do you love Jesus Christ?",

It is at once a gospel tract and a primer on hermeneutics: a statement of the first principles of the Christian testimony which the author sealed with his life. Drawing on Martin Luther’s earlier New Testament preface, Tyndale’s method is simple but profound. He briefly introduces about a dozen biblical ideas that shape our reading of the Bible: Old and New Testaments, law and gospel, nature and grace, Adam and Christ, and more.",
